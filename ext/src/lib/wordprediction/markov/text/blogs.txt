Chad has been awesome with the kids and holding down the fort while I work later than usual! The kids have been busy together playing Skylander on the XBox together, after Kyan cashed in his $$$ from his piggy bank. He wanted that game so bad and used his gift card from his birthday he has been saving and the money to get it (he never taps into that thing either, that is how we know he wanted it so bad). We made him count all of his money to make sure that he had enough! It was very cute to watch his reaction when he realized he did! He also does a very good job of letting Lola feel like she is playing too, by letting her switch out the characters! She loves it almost as much as him.
so anyways, i am going to share some home decor inspiration that i have been storing in my folder on the puter. i have all these amazing images stored away ready to come to life when we get our home.
With graduation season right around the corner, Nancy has whipped up a fun set to help you out with not only your graduation cards and gifts, but any occasion that brings on a change in one's life. I stamped the images in Memento Tuxedo Black and cut them out with circle Nestabilities. I embossed the kraft and red cardstock with TE's new Stars Impressions Plate, which is double sided and gives you 2 fantastic patterns. You can see how to use the Impressions Plates in this tutorial Taylor created. Just one pass through your die cut machine using the Embossing Pad Kit is all you need to do - super easy!

Other friends have similar stories, of how they were treated brusquely by Laurelwood staff, and as often as not, the same names keep coming up. About a half-dozen friends of mine refuse to step foot in there ever again because of it. How many others they’re telling - and keeping away - one can only guess.
Although our beloved Cantab can’t claim the international recognition afforded the Station Inn, otherwise these two joints feel like twins separated by nothing more than distance.

Peter Schiff: Hard to tell. It will look pretty bad for most Americans when prices will go way up and they can’t afford to buy stuff. It could also get very bad as far as loss of individual liberty. A lot of people will blame it on capitalism, on freedom, and they will claim we need more government. It could be used as an impetus for more regulation, which would be a disaster, or it could be an impetus to get rid of all the regulation that was causing the problem. But whether we will do the right or the wrong thing here in America, there will be a lot of pain first. We got some serious problems we have to deal with, but we are not dealing with the problems, we only make the problems worse.
3. Winter is the time when all sleeps on some level. It is a time of turning within to make contact with your own innermost being. Winter is the best time to do this and, as a result, get answers for yourself about whatever concerns you. It is also a tremendously creative time, a time for artists of all kinds to turn within and to seek images of forms he or she wishes to produce in whatever medium chosen, so that an image of balance can be presented. Those of you that write, we suggest that you do so to come up with plots and ideas that will speak of balance coming to an imbalanced situation, person, or world. To those of you who, like Priscilla, work with making patterns and designs, we would say remember the images and designs brought about by winter. White will challenge you to see what changes will manifest in the images you produce. We ask that you do this in your own environment.
I am en-route to Cornwall again. 3/4 months of slog and sun and sea too. Always a job needs doing in a tourist town. I’m bringing my stuff back from 97 on Friday. Will need to cancel bills before I retreat. Not such a bad thing. Moved to Leeds with promise from Millies. That went nowhere. Move on.

The one thing that was astounding though was the support from the marshals – they were all phenomenal for being out in the rain for so long and remaining so cheery and supportive. They were an amazing bunch. Owing to the nature of the course and very few closed roads meant that supporters who knew the area were able to skip around the course and a few people were seen about 5 or 6 times which was also super!!

A neighbor recommended “Chasing Fireflies” by Charles Martin. I’d never read anything by Martin before, although he was this neighbor’s favorite author. “Fireflies” is the story of Chase, a journalist who never knew his parents and was adopted by “Unc,” a colorful resident of a small Georgia town whose sayings and kind heart make him a memorable character. Chase is investigating the story of another orphan, this one a mute boy pushed out of a car on train tracks just before a train hit and killed his loser custodial “parent.”

Either Obama/Congress, etc. give in or, more likely, refuse. The group announces that the next device will be detonated in a populated area, with no warning. Again, “Obama,” et al., refuse to submit. This time the device is detonated in a mid-sized to major city. Tens of thousands die. (Think the atomic bombs that ended WWII.)
April was a month for new beginnings. Firstly, I finally finished my exams, and if all is good, I’ll be graduating in May. It still feels weird to know that the business degree I’ve been working for four years is finally mine. So now I’m in the process of looking for a new job. Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that’s a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I’ve made so far and the quality of books I’ve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it’s surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later.

When I was four years of age I remember being at home with my mom one day when a salesman tried breaking into our home. My mom was on the phone to her sister when the guy tried every door in the house. Her and I was curled up in a corner of the kitchen hiding with the phone hoping the guy would leave. It scarred me. I have never been trusting of them since this and I haven’t had one that has changed my mind.

Let’s say hypothetically, there is a bomb threat inside an airport. And there is only 10 minutes remaining it will explode. Inside the building there are few whites, blacks and Asian/middle eastern descents. And one of them has the code to disarm the bomb. So what would law enforcement do in a situation like this? Conduct a random check? Or eliminate the best possibilities by checking the Middle Eastern people first? If there are statistics and reasons to believe that threat comes from a certain race, is it unlawful to profile them? If a white man goes on a killing spree then should we waste time checking black men? Same goes to blacks or any other race. Isn’t it simple and smart to stay on facts and statistics or waste time and money by trying to be politically right?

I have it on good authority that everyone in this company, particularly the strikers, recieved gifts in the company-organised Secret Santa. I also know that the strikers attended the company-funded Xmas Party, where they partook in the company-funded luncheon. They also recieved vouchers to the value of K100, from the company as Xmas gifts.
I've also pondered a more permanent solution that involves several smaller chronological blogrolls organized by blog type (like the color codes). But that seems like a lot of work to create and maintain, and I'm not sure it would be helpful to the reader.

How many times have you heard someone say that so-and-so is too nice to tell the person they’re seeing that they want to call it quits, too nice to address unfair working conditions with their employer or too nice to ask someone to stop using that seat on the subway as a foot stool? There certainly are people who are soft-spoken and decidedly non-confrontational. But that doesn’t mean they’re nicer relative to everyone else. It’s just their personality. You can be assertive, honest and even outspoken and still be a very nice person.

On The Lovin’ People, he has the benefit of a good backing band consisting of Pretty Purdie on drums, Artie Butler on organ & piano, and Joe Mack and Bill Salter on bass. The band, who play both loose and funky without ever sounding sloppy, helped produce a more laid back vibe and Chandler sounds more relaxed than he did on the earlier album. He has some better songs on this one, too, such as the title cut warm, poppy number about...well, “Lovin’ People,” on which the presence of a chorus (made up on the spot of people who had gathered to provide assistance to a mothers’ help organization) also helps temper Chandler’s unfortunate tendency towards over-earnestness. “The Naked Fool” is about a relationship gone bad, which doesn’t have anything new to say but will have a few toes tapping. “Sold Out, No More Reservations” is an interesting number about a male groupie, and “Bound to Fly” has a nice soaring quality, and Chandler’s lyrics and delivery mesh well on it. If anything the problem here is that Chandler is sometimes eclipsed by his backing band—check “Behind Your Eyes” where the band goes off on some nice free jazz-psychedelic tangents while Chandler seems to be trying to channel Sammy Davis, Jr.
I was worried I wasn’t going to like this. And not because I have an unhealthy love of comic book heroes and unrealistic expectations. No, I was worried because it seems the 98% of people I know had already seen it and enjoyed it. Even the wife. Thus, wading in with an opinion of ‘pfft…shite’ would prove about as popular as punching a kitten in the face. But in the end the fears proved unfounded as I really did like it.

Ah, Parga. How many times have we sat in Paxos, looking across at the mainland at night seeing twinkling lights in the far distance? How many times have we wondered just what was it like over there? Well now we know. Unfortunately the place with the twinkling lights was not Parga but some other little community. We got it wrong. Parga was on the itinerary anyway. We concluded it was not worth the detour; two resort-y bays separated by an ancient Turkish fort on a steep hill and a cluster of souvenir shops, tavernas and restaurants. The marina was unwelcoming - we moored alongside a rusting, capsized ferry - and the trudge to buy some provisions took us along a neglected rubbish strewn track. Thomas would not leave the boat for fear we were robbed. But hey! Pull up the gangplank, crack open a beer and experiment with cooking in the galley.

I napped after studio class tonight. Andrew and I were up really late last night, despite going to bed at a somewhat decent time. We ended up talking to each other for about an hour and a half to two hours just about our lives and what was going on and stuff like that. It was a very nice talk, but it made me tired for today, which explains why I’m still awake now. But don’t worry…I’ll be getting to bed shortly, right after I shower.

Smokers I have little sympathy for – you made that decision, in the face of all the evidence that it’s not just seriously harmful to you, but to everyone around you, so I’m sorry, but you get to live with the consequences. And had I not lived, worked and socialised among smokers for most of my life, until the ban, I wouldn’t be anywhere near as ill as I am now, so sympathy is in very short supply.

- Food and drink disliking. I’m not really sure what the correct term is for this, but I developed a dislike for almost all of the foods that I once liked, and couldn’t drink fizzy pop at all! I think I may have literally lived on pickled onion space raiders and fruit juice for the entire first trimester…and possibly a lot of the second.
I recently tried a super fabulous restaurant that you MUST MUST try. I usually don't give restaurant recommendations, so trust me on this one. I decided to go down to South Norwalk and check out The SoNo Baking Company and Cafe that Martha Stewart is always yammering on about on Martha. This tiny hidden jewel was started by John Barricelli, who works for Martha and also hosts Everyday Baking on PBS. It is Fa. Bu. Lous. Seriously, that good. We had lunch and I tried a Cobb Salad that elevated the usual blah salad to a culinary masterpiece. I sat at the counter in front of a huge glass window and watched people roll out chocolate croissants with a vintage roller while I ate. (If you are a big geek, that is a huge thrill.) At one point in the meal, I actually saw John Barricelli through the glass instructing one of the bakers on how to place the chocolate chunks perfectly in the croissant. I considered banging on the glass to blow kisses and get my photo taken with him but I decided I had done that enough recently with both her and her, so I decided to play it cool and just eat my lunch quietly. I also brought home a huge selection of pastries and enjoyed every single one (in the name of research, not gluttony, mind you). John is coming out with a cookbook in early March. You can be a geek like me and pre-order your copy on Amazon today. The cafe is located right near the South Norwalk Aquarium and makes a good drive on a cold winter's day.

Of course it goes without saying that all the music above would probably have been familiar to Gardel's audience, too. But it's not that widely known here. It's not difficult or inaccessible music, but it's not a routine part of the popular culture in the same way that it would have been when Gardel was playing El dia que mi quieras, or even as it was when my grandmother's relations were making their own entertainment in Australia with performances of Bizet's Au fond du temple saint.

Valentines Day falls on February 14th each year. It is a holiday in which lovers express said love for each other, traditionally with flowers, candle lit dinners, heart shaped things, chocolate and greeting cards. The first Valentines cards were hand written but over time have made way for more mass produced greetings. These cards, for the most part, depict images of hearts, cupids and love struck victims.

Roughly a week later, my sister and her ever-expanding family drove in from Alaska and picked me up, and then we all headed on to Alvin, Texas, once a happy place where a son would be reunited with his father, but now a haunted little town where ghosts of memories reared their teeth at every turn. We pulled into the driveway at dusk, greeted by my stepmother and stepbrother, both of who appeared to be much stronger than me.

The product is a milky white liquid that applies like emulsion, not too creamy and thick, but not like water (or jelly) either. After spreading it out on your face, it dries within a few minutes. After which the fun begins! According to the SA, after it dries, you start rubbing it like you’re trying to rub dirt off your face, until you rub off most of it. If required, wash off the remaining with lukewarm water. So I started rubbing and it actually takes quite a bit of effort to rub it all off! It comes off in little bits like you’re rubbing off a layer of your skin.

Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, at the end of the kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision.
I have mixed emotions about the start to this book. As I’ve already mentioned I very much enjoyed the characters and the voice of the protagonist. But as much as I was enjoying it, it took me a little while to get into the story. We’re presented with a huge case of insta-love right from the start. Lucas, the mysterious and hot new neighbor, comes on strong. I’m pretty sure they start making out on their second or third meeting! I’m warning you now. There’s not a lot of rationalization for the insta-love…you won’t really understand the reasons until the end of the book. Which is why, in retrospect, I kinda like that I had to wait for all of the info to be revealed.

Sometimes, I just want to read a book. It’s kinda like Freud said, “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” Well in my case, sometimes I just need to read an actual hard or soft cover book, feel the paper against my fingers, smell the newness or musty oldness. If it’s a new book, there is something quite satisfying about being the first one to crack it open. I love to turn the pages, hear the crinkle and switch as my fingers brush against the paper.

I think I did three sets of revisions in the end. The first involved clarifying the plot. I kept moving away from the main thread and rambling in different directions. Once I’d mastered that I had to switch some chapters round and cut some bits out then work a little on the dialogue. Plotting has been the most difficult part of writing so far. But through writing Shine, I studied plot hard, learned a lot and with my second book, Glitter, due out on Sept. 2nd, I had one small amount of editing to do. I kept waiting for Rachel to send the MS back with more to do when I discovered it was already with the copyeditor!

This stuff is actually happening. It’s threatening our survival. And it’s not just the environment. And I’m writing it to know that, among the peaceful: you are not crazy for thinking that we are approaching a turning point in our country where the realities of decades of profit-over-all-else mentality are becoming not just undeniable, but are confronting us in our day to day lives in ways we did not think was possible in a country that now seems, in retrospect, to have been the least Western, least democratically-minded country to be considered so. And that turning point might require widespread civil disobedience, in the name of the environmental and economic survival of our country and our people (as well, of course, as the vast masses like us all around the world, in other countries).

There came a point, maybe three years into that, where I began to realise I'd have to have another go at a novel. Giant Thief didn't originate with any one story, but it did come out of not wanting to make the mistakes I'd made with my first attempt at novel writing. I was writing one or two short stories a month, and I didn't want to lose that pace. So it had to be something fast-paced, fun, not too convoluted. Something I could throw myself into and just keep moving with.

In reporting on activities to Chloe, I invented the chick-flick scale, my very own movie rating system. Instead of stars, chick flicks get 1 to 4 hearts (of course). Here are mini reviews of the movies I've watched this past week or so.

Alyssa is now 10 and has been busy with Volleyball, Girlscouts, and Sunday School. It seems like we are always running with her somewhere. She was struggling in reading in school a few months back, and was put into special reading help class; which was in turn taking time away from her math time and causing her to struggle in math; but she has now caught up with her reading, and has turned her math skills around as well. Conferences are just around the corner, and we have high hopes for her. We repainted her room for her last Birthday and gave her all new bedding and furniture. She has more things in her room, than time to play with the stuff...but what kid doesn't I guess.We don't get to see her as much as we would like to, but we cherish the time we do get with her. We have a lot of fun things planned to do with her on the weekends we have with her, let's hope we don't wear her out!
The concept of the King's Peace first appeared during the reign of Richard I in 1195. Peace was henceforth to be seen as the responsibility of the king, and its breach required that the culpable parties be answerable to him. During the reign of Edward III in 1361, Justices of the Peace were appointed for the first time. The Crown, in effect, was claiming a monopoly on violence in the realm, and appointing officials to enforce it.
The black sports coat, white button-up shirt, khaki slacks, and leather loafers he wore were all tailored and very expensive giving the impression of him being some sort of major player in the world trying to lay low and relax. It was a thought that Peter was beginning to believe more and more about himself as his sales numbers rocketed into orbit.
After the war memorial, and Northwood Station, we turned right just after St Helen's School towards Northwood Hills. My two South London colleagues were pleased that there actually was a hill. We were surprised at the number of closed-down shops in this apparently affluent area, but the William Jolle pub still seemed to be thriving. (Because it is a Wetherspoons establishment, I can tell you that he was a local 14th century resident) The former pub opposite had, however, metamorphosed into the Namaste Lounge.

The only not-so-fabulous part was that as I was getting the monkeys in the tub, I started to sneeze. And feel drippy and tickly. Sure signs of an end-of-summer cold. Bluck. I feel icky this morning, but have too much to do to be sick. So I am refusing to succumb to my desire to plop on the couch and sniff all day. I am hoping sheer will alone will heal me :)
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for teaching me to prayer earnest, heartfelt and continued prayers. As I spend time to pray like this today, Your divine power is manifested, changes are effected, and circumstances in my life are changed, in Jesus Christ Name I pray! Amen!
Last week, he was so worked up about some things that were not actually real. He laid down in his bed and kept going over and over them with me. I told him he just needed to relax, that he didn't need to worry so much. He is being so well cared for. He gave me the silent soul searching steel blue stare, softly grabbed my hand, and said, "I'll always remember you."

From Peru, we flew to Ecuador and then on to the wedding. After the celebrations, we were off to Hawaii, for a much needed relaxing beach holiday, after which we did a wonderful cruise of The Great Barrier Reef, before flying home via Singapore. What a great trip that was, and one day I’ll put some more photos up for you to see.
I gave Nick S a call before I got there and he told me that Tim CC was on his way up to get it, so I did a quick pass 500′ over a couple of pilots on takeoff, then headed back over Aber.
This race is a top-notch way to break into the triple digits for the first time. That’s why I keep coming back and I always bring others with me. The volunteers are wonderful. The food and support system is exceptional. And the race direction is flawlessly efficient. Joe Prusaitis certainly knows how to put on a quality event! Those of us that stuck around for the award ceremony brought home a special Texas Trinket for being one of the most interesting out-of-town groups.

When it comes to making my own salsas at home, I've often limited myself to making the usual salsas that involve fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos, an onion, some cilantro and a bit of lime juice... or pico de gallo. And from time to time, I may make the salsa verde, guacamole, or the black bean and corn salsa.... even the quick, budget-friendly avocado sauce. They are all excellent. But recently I managed to make 2 different salsas, opening the door to a new way of making salsa for me... using various chiles to add depth and flavor.

That’s why there’s cache. Cache-memory access is almost as fast as register access, but you can have a lot of cache memory—comparatively. L1 caches typically have 32 or 64Kbyte capacities and often there are independent caches for instructions and data. Caches take a huge load off main memory, relieving the pressure to speed up main-memory access.
“When one has seen one house he has seen them all, the same everlasting high stoops and gloomy brown-stone fronts, the same number of holes punched in exactly the same places,” Osman quotes a late 19th century writer as lamenting. “The new brownstone and trolley grid inspired 19th century eulogies for a real and imagined agricultural landscape,” Osman writes.
Anyway, Howl is the dashing wizard that Sophie fell in love with. He was self-absorbed. In the movie it was said that Howl’s heart was young and immature (something like that). At first he wasn’t capable of loving anyone. I guess to be able to understand the film, we have to understand Howl’s relationship with Calcifer.

The message of Journey of the Universe shows how we are not just a part of this astonishing process, we are at the very edge of evolution, a primate species that has found in its language and symbols the power to take over the very evolutionary process itself. But this control that we now exercise comes with a responsibility; and viewers of Journey of the Universe will not only be imbued with a sense of astonishment at all that has taken place, they will also come to feel the excitement in learning that now we live in a time when the human species is being asked to play a central role in activating the flourishing powers of Earth’s living systems.
They are both chunky knits and were a complete bargain-the green was £1 and the multi colour knit was £2!! The charity shops have now started putting out their winter stocks so using these knits as inspiration, why don't you go and hunt down a stylish cosy bargain for much less than the high street or designer versions?
Skully was struggling to breath at this point, shaking and pawing his head, gagging and his eyes reflected his fear. Poor little guy! He was also snapping his teeth, tryin' to dislodge the jerky.

Freddie did spend some time in Vietnam too; I think he told us he used to make maps there. But we never pushed it because who knew if he would “Freak out” about it. And Freddie knew just about everything you know, politics, art, religion, history, philosophy, and most important, Brooklyn.

Again, I’ve just begun working on what Mr. Licata told me and I’ll post more later but if its true, it would make a great book: corrupt lawyers, bribed judges and completely crooked bankers engaging in mortgage fraud and outright theft. Real estate slows down from about the end of May and won’t really resume until September so maybe I’ll devote some of that free time to writing this up – it’s got the ingredients for a great tale.
I was recently given the assignment to select one word that describes me and write about it. At first this sounded so simple, but in my usual fashion I spent a little too much time dwelling over it. I wear many badges. I am a wife, a mother, a daughter, a teacher, a friend....you get my point. The word that returned to me most often and a word I've never used to describe myself was pray-er, a person that prays. I questioned if it was really a word...it is...I looked it up. It is seldom used, but it is a word.
It's official, I made the 2012 Spellbinders team. It's been an amazing year and I am so glad that it doesn't have to end. I love this company, their products, their values, and the people who make Spellbinders what it is.
Or at least, the US does. Why don’t things like this exist? Adults like to have fun as much as kids do, although maybe the urge to play has either died down naturally or been repressed by responsibilities. Playgrounds are a great way for kids to run, jump, and get some exercise while enjoying themselves, but what like that exists for adults? If you want fun, it’s usually either expensive or relatively sedentary like walking or hiking. If you want cheap exercise … lace up those running shoes. (And I don’t deny that some people gain enjoyment from running, but I sure don’t.)
And the paint. I have read every blog and article on the web that discusses painting cabinets and I tried something completely different from what I had read. Have you seen those commercials for Behr "He is painting while he primes. She is priming while she paints?" I went for the premium primer included stuff from Home Depot. The black color is Behr Beluga. I painted 3 coats, sanding lightly between each one. I didn't remove the doors but I easily could (and probably should) have. I decided to distress them. This my husband wasn't too thrilled about but I know how my kids and their stool had already distressed them over the years so I figured I would save myself the headache and heartache and have them start distressed. I hit it several places with the sander and then used a darker tinted glaze (some watered down acrylic craft paint) over the sanded spots to darken up the distressed areas.
I’m pretty late to the LCD Soundsystem party (a great oversight on my part), but thankfully rectified with Mr James Murphy’s third (and final?) outing of liquid crystal disco. It sounds effortlessly cool, but there’s so much going on, it’s just plain fun to listen to, dance to and do just about anything to – be it the washing up, filling out an application form or being attacked by PANDUHS!

During this time, peaceful occupiers have been faced with continual harassment arrests, almost invariably on fabricated charges (“disorderly conduct,” “interfering with the conduct of a police officer”—the latter a charge that can be leveled, for instance, against those who try to twist out of the way when an officer is hitting them.) I have seen one protestor at Union Square arrested, by four officers using considerable force, for sitting on the ground to pet a dog; another, for wrapping a blanket around herself (neither were given warnings; but both behaviors were considered too close to “camping”); a third, an ex-Marine, for using obscene language on the Federal steps. Others were reportedly arrested on those same steps for singing a satirical version of the “Officer Krumpke” song from West Side Story. Almost no march goes by without one or two protestors, at least, being hurled against vehicles or have their heads bashed against the ground while being arrested for straying off the sidewalk. The message here is clear. Law has nothing to do with it. Anyone who engages in Occupy Wall Street-related activity should know they can be arrested, for virtually any reason, at any time.
6. Meyerman - Who Do You Think You Are?
I'm a voracious reader. Always have been. As a teenager, my parents ended up having to hide my books so I would get my chores done because I would spend every chance I got reading. It didn't really change when I had a family, except no one had to hide my books so I'd get my chores done. :P

I'm in the process of building out an entire enchanted forest in one inch scale as part of my set for the Myrtle short film. Trees complete with faces and jelly jars hanging from the branches filled with fireflies / will o' the wisps. It's starting to look pretty good and I'm pleased with how the glass jars light up. They're all hand-blown glass and less than 1 cm in height. So like me, this project is pretty teeny.

Data-mining programs will provide these abusers of power with powerful tools for creating enemies lists, and for targeting them, as described in EFAD. Social media networks are already under intensive federal scrutiny. This year, it is ostensibly to track down undefined terrorist threats. But social media, so popular today, must be understood as a two-edged sword. The same social media that facilitated the Arab Spring, today brings the secret police of Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations to the doors of obscure bloggers hidden in tiny apartments, to drag them away to secret torture cells.
I was walking back from my girlfriend’s house through Park South, a notoriously run-down area of Swindon, riddled with unemployment, anti-social behaviour and crime. It’s not the area of Swindon I normally associate with a ‘passion for politics’, but as I crossed the water logged field I saw a purple and yellow glow from a window. ‘VOTE UKIP’. Wait, what? – This took me by surprise, Park South has always been a Labour stronghold, we have all seen it in the media that the ‘smaller’ parties are going to do well tomorrow, but this really hit home for me. It’s bitter-sweet.

Due to the nature of my job (raising children) I find my cleaning standards have slipped somewhat. After a day spent washing up, sweeping food off the kitchen floor, wiping all the surfaces, picking up toys and random objects up off every floor in the house, cooking, looking after my kids, making beds, and hanging washing out, seventeen times over, I have no remaining energy to do any actual cleaning.

But wait, broadcast industry opponents say. Aren’t broadcasters the rich and powerful few disenfranchising the rest of the country from having ubiquitous wireless broadband? Only they won’t say it quite like that, but the point is worth examining. Just 10 to 15 percent of U.S. households rely exclusively on over-the-air television. There is some evidence of cord-cutting–i.e., people ditching pay service for free TV–but not to the extent to suggest that ratio will double anytime soon. And we don’t know much yet about the adoption rate of mobile over-the-air TV because where is it already?
Our system is broken. Government serves the interest of big business and big business only serves the interest of a very few, wealthy elites. It’s time to make our economy and our politics work for working people.

I was nervous about reading this passage. It's pretty emotional. That's some crazy brutality, you know? They aren't dying fast enough as they slowly suffocate on a cross where they are hanging by their hands and feet so let's break their legs so they die faster. Oh- he's already dead so let's put a gash in his side so that he bleeds.

Was hoping I would only have to beat cancer once, but the disease continues to foolishly pick on the wrong guy.
I've got to admit that I didn't know the Norfolk Broads was water, for some reason I just imagined it being fields. We learned little bits about it along the way, like they're man-made, but I did a bit more research here and have learned that the Broads is now the UK's largest nationally protected wetland. They are a man-made creation, formed when people dug for peat! Who knew?
“I don’t think that is the best way for having these changes. I don’t know on what basis they are going to charge us. The best option is dialogue,” said Asfaw Dingamo, Ethiopia’s minister of water resources.
I rode from my house to RC1's house and when I was just about there I came to a place in the trail where it stopped suddenly with friendly 'no trespassing' signs suggesting that I find another route. Instead, I picked up my bike and crossed the rail road tracks anyway. That experience loosely parallels my week. Pushing forward, creating my own path... That or a silly rummycube analogy about switching around the tiles until they fit just right. I like thinking in metaphor.
The juices today were the best yet. Breakfast was like a chilled, spiced carrot soup and lunch was like a thin salsa. Plus I had the Chocolate Nut Milk again for dinner because it was so enjoyable last night.

The morning was HARSH. Anytime I completely lose it to that extent (see yesterdays posts), I always wake up feeling like I got ran over by a semi-truck. My body did NOT want to move and I hurt SO bad. I was late getting DD to school, but I got her there. And from that point on……I’m pretty sure Hell froze over.
The wisdom of the world is still foolish today. One of the great discussion topics of our age is how we get to heaven. The pervasive world view is that everybody will get there some day depending on what you’re looking for. The world’s view claims it doesn’t matter which path you follow to get there. Many in the world’s intellectual and scientific communities believe heaven and hell don’t even exist. We who are being saved, however, know that Jesus would not have gone to the cross if He did not know there was something beyond this world. Those of us who are being saved also know human wisdom costs a person everything, but Godly wisdom affords us everything.

We’ll have faith because we’re clean — not just because of what Jesus did — but because we lived in Him, righteous, by His grace we overcame. We didn’t shrink back. We made sure that we stayed right with Him. We’re supposed to walk like Jesus walked. We can’t just do our own thing and think it’s okay because of some formula. “Without holiness, no man will see God.”

She uses a cat litter with self-absorption-odor absorption qualities unequaled in history.We have invented so many devices, and machines, and applications to machines, machines that replace machines, that we no longer have to lift ourselves out of bed.

Of course, there’s a moral to this tale ~ a little piece of wisdom that you can apply to your own stay in the transitional zone of Veterans Campus. And that moral is: if you don’t like the roommate you got now, don’t worry. Be happy. You’ll get along just fine, sooner or later, like Davy Crockett & Paragon did ~ Paragon, that poor old rattlesnake with the negative aura so thick around him that it was downright impossible for him to see through it.
Armadillo came about because I wanted to see more review space for children's books. Barn Owl because Ann, an ex-teacher, believed passionately that good children's books went out of print all too soon in a market increasingly interested only in quick and plentiful sales. It's even worse now but none of us knew that at the time.

Twice a week she will go over to a school near our house and work with the specialist. They can increase it or decrease it, if needed. The lady who does it, is a member we know from our local pool, so that was nice seeing a friendly face. She told me I look just like Betty Draper from Mad Men. This made me laugh, and I felt the need to tell her I didn't drink or smoke while pregnant with Emily, like Betty did. This lady can be my BFF though for thinking I look like her though.
Michael helped me hold up the arches while I drilled in a few pilot holes and some dry wall screws. It's a good idea to really get those screws in flush with the MDF or even counter-sunk so you can't see them later. We installed the flat trim in the same way.

“The church she requested to attend is 180 degrees different from the ramblings of that hell, fire and brimstone preacher,” said Parnham. “She would just like to get back into a stable church whereby God and Christianity become a role in her life. There’s nothing nefarious about that.”

Mr. Requiro has soloed with the Tokyo Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, and and other orchestras across the U.S. His Carnegie Hall debut recital at Weill Hall was followed by a critically acclaimed San Francisco Performances recital at the Herbst Theatre. Soon after making his Kennedy Center debut, Mr. Requiro also completed the cycle of Beethoven’s Sonatas for Piano and Cello at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. Actively involved in contemporary music, he has collaborated with composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Bright Sheng and most recently gave the Dutch premier of Pierre Jalbert’s Sonata for cello and piano at the 2010 Amsterdam Cello Biennale.

SXSW: The roller coaster ride of SXSW is not well recorded. Lines, crowds, and an ass load of crappy bands can make you anxious. You are watching the third mediocre band of the night. You want to leave, but your friends like the band. You go to see your "can't miss pick of the night". There's a line. You wait for 15 minutes. You give up and wander. You try not to be pissed. You make a random call: "The Red Eyed Fly always has good Kharma for bands". You stop in to find the drunkest bunch of musicians you've ever seen playing the most kick ass gypsy music ever. A beer distributor gives you a free beer to "try" it. You've had it before, but pretend not to. You call your friends to come over cause "it kicks ass". Life is good.

Every day. Every single day I do this with my nemesis I75. And every single day I remember what a dumbass I am for thinking I can beat the odds, that I won't be thinking unkind thoughts about whomever caused the accident that has resulted in the bumper to bumper clusterfuck that is the worst commute in the nation. I lament the fact that they don't have formal drivers' education here, that the public transportation system is pretty much nonexistent and, of course, I berate myself for once again for forgetting that the back roads aren't just more scenic. They're more efficient, too.
Cake is always a very big party of wedding days, with that being said I've only ever eaten cake at one friends wedding and that is simply because it was forced down my throat by the groom. Odd, yes but it was a prank the Bride and Groom tried to play on myself and the bestman. I saw the prank coming a mile away and mouthed to the Bestman to "Duck!" he didn't understand and as I ducked and ran he got cake smashed in his face by the bride. The groom then chased me down and around the dance floor finally tackling me and giving me cake. Thankfully he and I are very close friends or I might have been really pissed not only at my bride/bff but at him too. Most weddings I go to I'm too busy dancing, or drinking to care about sweets, so while I was excited about planning my cake for my own wedding - I wasn't really concerned about eating it.

Southend has suffered from its reputation as a place of down-market entertainment. The fun-fair atmosphere lends credence to this, persuading the snobs that this is not a place to visit, much less to be seen in, but I think that does Southend less than justice. There is more to the place than pubs, fish and chips and games arcades. In any case, I rather think that the merry chink of money in the tills removes any concerns about what the snobs think.

Working in the tech environment that we do with creative advertising types you would expect to see a lot of iPods, digital camera’s and laptops. And you do. But I kind of always assumed that it was because of the environment. I guess with the news that Apple have managed to flog 100 million of the things in the last 5 years or so it stands to reason that you’re gonna see them out there amongst the masses :)
Not content with charging enormous up-front sums for leases on the pubs they own, the big pub chains have the nerve to then charge rent for the premises on top of that. They also dictate that the lessor "keep the standard of the pub up to their specification", so that a publican is not even allowed to decorate his own pub without their approval.
My party is a Hostess Appreciation Tea which is actually on my schedule for June. I can't wait to make the Creativity Journals with my sweet guests. We'll have hot teas, scones and quiche with a few other treats too. I enjoy this event so much each year, and I think the Journals will add to our fun.

After so many incidents in which Palestinian propaganda has managed to rearrange the narrative so that the Israeli side appears to be the aggressor, we could expect the IDF brass, as well as Israel’s government, to show restraint, perhaps count to 30, before throwing their own man under the media bus. But, alas, both IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned a senior IDF officer for the way he appears on a selectively edited Palestinian video on You Tube.

The surprising success at Prestonpans was the tinder that sparked the initial success of the Jacobite revolt in 1745: on 21 September 1745 the Jacobite army loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart and led by his son Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) defeated the government army loyal to the Hanoverian George II led by General Sir John Cope at Prestonpans – a few miles outside Edinburgh.

Noticing is what effected change for Simba in The Lion King. The voice of his father echoing from the past at last reminded him of that which he had long forgotten to pay attention to—his heart, his purpose, and his true identity. As he chose to be responsive to the truth, he was able to face his fears and return to the Pride Lands with a new perspective.
I ultimately reminded myself that all of our circumstances are different. I really know nothing about these people. Maybe their children were older and working independently when they became single moms. Maybe they didn’t start off their single parenthood with no money. Maybe they have grandparents nearby who help out. Maybe they didn’t move to a foreign country where they have no work history the year before they became single parents. Who knows. All I can focus on is where my situation is right now and how to best handle it.

I’ve been told by more than one person that I have the mouth of a sailor. Some of my favorite expletives involve a combination of the words “hairy,” “ballsack,” and “wrinkly.” This didn’t come naturally for me. I had to work at it, practice my trade, experiment with new combinations. I’ve worked very hard to have a mouth even the British Orbit lady couldn’t clean up.
During our visit Iceland was unseasonably cold. It was so cold in fact that we purchased an extra layer at Iceland's own 66˚N so we could withstand the coldness. Being on a boat only amplified that and we had to remember that this is summer.

“I have worked for 40 years, paid taxes for 40 years and paid NI for 40 years. I have been on DLA for 6 years and if I were still able to work I would still be on £40,000 pa and have a company car instead of a Motorbility car. I would travel the country using my first class rail warrant and stay in 4* hotels using my generous expense account. I had dignity, self belief, respect and I loved my job. However, it would seem that one day I decided to become disabled, poverty stricken and treated like a criminal. As a life style choice it was a disaster! Now it seems I am guilty of attempted fraud, worthless, a burden on society and a waste of space. Does anybody really believe that I prefer my life now? Drug addicts, while also needing help, are treated with more compassion and they made an informed choice to start using. I did not choose to be this way and I expect to be given as much support.” Derek Benyon, Leicestershire; sick for 7 years
I recently cancelled my cable (for the second time) due to escalating costs and a general disgust at the lack of quality programming. I won’t lie and say I’ve never indulged in reality smut for entertainment. I have caught myself watching Bachelor Pad and no part of me is proud of it. It is the “train-wreck” factor that keeps people paying attention to most of the stuff that passes for good TV.
I told by boss my leaving date this week and put the rumours to rest. Clients naturally got told first, but news travels fast with only a matter of weeks to go and soon everyone knew. condolences and wishes of good luck come flooding in, the work floods in and dries up at the same time – it is a funny one.

We had a conference with the neonatologist this afternoon and he said that her breathing issues are a result of her prematurity and she would need to stay in the NICU until she is able to breathe without assistance and keep her pulse ox in the 90s. This could take days or weeks, every baby is different.

I don’t mean to be disrespectful and I know that Mike Melvoin — who penned five tunes, including the New York songs, on the album and lends his considerable talents on piano — unfortunately passed away in February. But I can’t help feeling I’ve heard this all before. Basse is compared by some critics and the album’s publicity to Mel Torme, Ray Charles and Dr. John (Dr. John, really?) but in truth he’s a lot closer to Harry Connick, Jr. without as much sparkle and wit.

He may not always take part in our insane escapades or hang around the newsroom as much as we do, but I love Ryan too death. I know he’s all Arts and Entertainment now, but he can never forget where he started – an Assistant News Editor. There are very few people I would put money on, but Ryan is one of them. He’s not only going places, but he’s already gotten places. I’ve never seen anyone at the paper that can write a feature like this kid. He’s pretty awesome.

In itself, the tale of the publication of Into the Cannibal’s Pot: Lessons For America From Post-Apartheid South Africa bears telling. For while this polemic respects no political totems or taboos, it is faithful to facts. These facts cried out to be chronicled. They should not have had a struggle to find their way into print.
The victim’s friend, a young woman, tried to pull him back into his car. Attackers came after her, pulling her hair, punching her head and causing a bloody scratch to the surface of her eye. She called 911. A recording told her all lines were busy. She called again. Busy. On her third try, she got through and, hysterical, could scream only their location.

When I got to the park I confirmed with the ranger that there was a water fountain at the summit. I knew this would be about 11 miles and I figured I had enough water to get me up there. Once at the top, the Visitor Center, my options for getting back opened up. It felt like a safe plan, so I went for it. Halemau’u Trailhead to the Summit, then possibly back from there or a quick trip back to the car via the road that went to the summit, or, I could hitchhike down if I needed it.
We were sad to see the last course, but in a way we were so stuffed, we couldn’t have fit anymore. Unlike Kristien, I have a natural hatred of all things cheesecake, so I had a big decision to make during the whole meal. Would I eat the Marscapone Cheesecake that was served with strawberries and basil? At first I wasn’t sure, but just after the amuse bouche I knew that I trusted Chef Arik to give me something that would blow me away. Let me say, this was an amazing dessert. It was not too sweet and just right in terms of creaminess. The little ribbons of basil, too, added nice bursts of flavor to the cake. Mary paired this course with a great Muscat from Rurtherglen that wasn’t overly sweet.

Each morning when we roll out of bed we are given the world. We can make that day into anything we want just by starting the day right. I must admit, most mornings I hit snooze 10 times, each time dreading more the next time it goes off. The second that alarm goes off I flood my head with negative thoughts; 'ugg its another work day', 'I wonder what fires I will have to put out today', 'I can't wait until today is over', 'why did he break up with me?'. I'll give you one guess how my days turn out! I am a self-fulfilling prophecy. My days are slow, filled with turmoil and work problems, and I am sad and lonely. So today I tried something new! My alarm when off and I smiled. Not because I wanted to but because I needed to. I kissed my dog good morning and she bounced happily out of bed. Down the stairs we went and made some tea and scrubbed the kitchen clean. I drove to work listening to happy music, I greeted everyone with a smile, I sent out 'Good Morning!' texts. I greeted my work crew and checked in with them and I made another cup of tea. Then I opened my reader and found just what I needed to read on Elephant Journal :

It was not a brighter day in Nassau. It rained the entire trip but we were going on the island this time. You can’t let a little rain ruin your vacation. It is all about how you make your experience. We even made fashionable rain outfits out of trash bags! Some of us had on dresses, cardigans, and coats made out of a plastic bag. It was hilarious and we dressed it up with accessories like belts. When we got off the ship we ran to the island, which we didn’t need to do because there were shuttles taking us from the ship to the entrance of the island. We got wet for nothing but we kept pressing on.
Before the Lord ever brought Caleb, my husband, into my life, it was my desire to find ways, as a single girl, that I could be a blessing to a future husband that I didn't know yet. I sought to find ways that I could be a Proverbs 31 wife, bringing her husband good all the days of her life, and during this time, I made a list of some applicable things I could do for my future husband that would act as blessing.

The other thing I love about this is that I don’t have to start out all kinds of wonderful. God seems to be very generous when it comes to handing me seeds to plant. It’s good, because new gardeners and farmers make mistakes in their planting. Planting or sowing isn’t merely a matter of throwing handfuls of seeds onto the ground and hoping for the best. Some seeds must be planted deeper than others. Some need more space while some are good with crowding. Some need more water or more sun or more acid or more alkalinity. The production of a really beautiful, vibrant, fruitful harvest will probably be the end result of lots of mistakes and failures as the new gardener learns and becomes an experienced gardener. The gardener who achieves fruitfulness will be the one who persevered. “Doing good” seems much the same.

I had a meeting yesterday with the team at Simon & Schuster, along with my agent Luigi Bonomi. They detailed the global campaign planned for COVENANT, and it is utterly awesome. I learned a huge amount about how the campaign is designed to produce 'tail-off', maintaining a book's prominent placing on the shelves, along with all sorts of details involving the television adverts, posters, on-line and supermarket promotions. The list was immense, and apparently regarded as one of the biggest and best debut launch campaigns ever seen ( in Australia ).
I created formats for my comics, books, CD’s, DVD’s…even my video games. I’d like to talk about the books.xml file I put together, and how it’s changed across 7 years.
And suddenly, I was a multi-tasker. My MamaEar was attuned to the cry of my kids. And it was good. To everyone but the adult trying to talk to me. But I figured, the adult could deal. The baby and the toddler had to be attended to. Or a ruckus would be raised, in my honor. And frankly, while I appreciated the effort involved, I could do without the ruckus. Who needs one more ruckus?

Look closely, though, and the belief in a 2012 apocalypse has a great deal in common with the belief that asset prices can have an infinite upside. Both beliefs offer grand narratives that replace the ordinary patterns of human existence with a something-for-nothing fantasy. The bubble believers insist that they can have limitless wealth without having to work for it; the 2012 believers insist that they can have the new and improved world they think they want—whether that amounts to a new age of enlightenment, on the one hand, or a Hollywood movie world of heroic survivors blazing away against hordes of roving zombies, on the other—without having to work for it. In either case, what drives the fantasy is the conviction that it makes sense to sit on your backside and wait for the market, or the space brothers, or something else to give you the future you think you deserve.
The main problem with appealing to epicycles & deferents is that while it may explain features like retrograde motion and make reasonably accurate predictions (such as the old Ptolemaic model), it isn’t consistent with other celestial observations, such as…

Dundrum Town Centre was opened in 2005 having been built by Anglo “Golden Circle” member Joe O’Reilly and fellow Longford man, the late Liam Maye. The site was reportedly bought for €10.2m. With 79,000 sq metres it claims to be the biggest shopping centre in the State. It is reported to contribute some €7m per annum in local authority rates to DunLaoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The Irish Times claims that the centre had a footfall of 19m, that is 19m visitors, last year and further claims “a great many of them from the affluent south Dublin suburbs”. Phase II of the centre has been given the green light by planning authorities but its future is in doubt against the backdrop of the economic crisis – Phase II was to have been a €600m development which would have seen 101,000 sq metres of space added making the shopping centre the largest in Europe.

In the mean time, I decided to start keeping track of just what words Goldie can say. I started yesterday counting only spoken words, no matter how hard they were to understand. I was blown away that she used 87 different words!! I had no idea she was using that many. Today we weren't as diligent, but I noticed a bunch of words that she didn't say yesterday, so tomorrow we are going to keep track again. I also think its important that most of these were said without prompting. She either initiated the conversation or repeated them after I used them in a sentence. Goldie is not a "performer" so the best way to know where she is developmentally is to watch and interact with her during normal family routines.
I'm getting off topic here. I'm starting to rant and rave a little.

As of January 1st. 2011 every cab will run on meters. The meters will be paid for by the owners of the company, the meters will be purchased from a distributor to be named by the city. Every cab will run the same model of meter and will be calibrated by the distributor every 6 months. The cost of calibration will be covered by the owner/broker of the cab.
Hubby and I have never been to one of the celebrations, but so many people visit that there would be no place to park, and no way to get near the elephant enclosure anyway.

The connection between the title & the story only surfaces after you are about 80% into the book, leaving me very non-motivated to even read further to find out what the iron tooth is about in the first place. Even when I did find out what the iron tooth is about, & how it helps the story move further, it’s too late, since the author by then had successfully bored me.
This association is like Summer in a mouthful, if Summer were to decide she got a little tired of eating salad and drinking water all day long. This is the part when Summer gets fun.
Naturally the move has taken a lot of time, Thursday and Friday last week were busy days regarding this. However, my time was not all spend humping furniture a fifty five years of collected items, on Saturday, along with Liz Hazell, our Walsall UKIP branch treasurer and Albert and Graham Duffen from Birmingham, I drove up to Skegness for the UKIP Spring Conference – which to say the least was a very uplifting day – UKIP is really on the march now and becoming a real threat to the other, longer established but totally failed, political parties.

How are you affected by the size of the room you’re in?
Over the past year or so, I've been in a lot of boutiques that are a little new to me. A big reason for that has been location--Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Paris offer some great stores. But I knew what I wanted to look at long before I walked in. In Burberry, I wanted to find THE trench, and I did. How? I walked in, I started looking around, I got approached, and I accepted the offer of help. I told the sales assistant that I was only looking (I said this first off), but I felt it time to think about investing in a trench (given I've been considering this for ten years, my sense of time clearly is fluid). The ensuing discussion and try-ons were about fitting me. That's it. I took the information on the sales assistant's card. When I decide to purchase it, he's who I call. It was all professionally handled--my end, his end. In other words, it wasn't about the cupid's singing--it was about finding information.
In 1950, the remains of Wingate and his nine companions were disinterred from their grave in India. With his family’s agreement, Wingate was taken to what US Military personnel hold to be sacred ground. On the old plantation of confederate General Robert E. Lee, in what is now Arlington National Cemetery, Orde Charles Wingate was laid to rest with full military honors. The fact that this was done at a time when the United States was occupied by the expansion of communism in Asia and a frightening face off with Soviet forces in Europe speaks volumes about how highly the United States Military regarded Orde Wingate.
As a result, it was immensely refreshing for me to read the below article by Aadil Palkhivala, an Ayurvedic practitioner who is widely regarded as one of the world’s top yoga teachers. Things that particularly resonated with me are his simple yet powerful statements like ‘There is no perfect diet, and no ideal food. I encourage you to monitor your food intake to determine what works for you and what doesn’t—diet has to be adjusted individually’. Good common sense in many respects, and principles that are easy to follow and live by. I look forward to reading much more from this wise man!

So God suffers, in other words we suffer, especially our most male component that tries to do good. In other words we believe that any really good men will need to suffer to the point of dying, which in turn will make accompanying good women suffer accordingly, which in turn will make it even harder for people not particularly good at life to catch a break, and since it will be done unto us as we believe, no wonder we can’t seem to stop killing each other incessantly for even two minutes at any given point in time. No wonder we keep ourselves perpetually too lazy to clean up after our own filth, or toss a can in a recycling bin. No wonder those of us who believe that God is greater than the consciousness of a suffering person constantly have to work harder after those who insist on worshipping suffering itself as though it is their own God; as if it is themselves. Since it shall be done unto us as we believe, or at least so says that guy supposedly, can we stop believing in a suffering God now and start believing in a happy one? It seems to be what Jesus would have wanted for us; to believe in a happy God. Or would anyone rather believe in a God that wants us to suffer?
I feel more comfortable walking along the shore (a more open, spacious feeling). When I am walking the trails in the wooded parks, it feels more closed in and secluded and I'm not comfortable walking alone.

Jim discloses that he was looking at a wall comprised of hundreds upon hundreds of infant bodies, all wrapped in Buddhist ceremonial fabrics, stacked one upon another. Again, Garrow provides no clues with which to test the veracity of this statement, and its purpose seems designed to re-enforce the Western view that the Chinese kill their unwanted daughter's wholesale, against all verifiable evidence to the contrary.

Oh and before I forget, our special sister, Deb’, well she requested we ordered her a new sim card, she wanted to make sure her soon to be ex-husband couldn’t text or ring her so that was organised, although ironically, whilst standing in the O2 shop, he rang and we hung up on him 3 times within a matter of minutes before removing the battery and sim card and oops he can’t contact her again on there, whoopee.

Iran armed their first wave of missiles with EMP warheads designed to unleash a devastating shockwave that destroyed all electronics as soon as they were shot down by the missile defense system.

In other news, yesterday, our friend Amy decided, for her birthday, to conduct a full, costumed, drunken enactment of "Annie," held at a local theater (off hours). I'd say there were about 50 people there plus a bunch of kids. Many were costumed (myself included,) many were drunk on gin and tonics at 10 in the morning (ditto). Sadly, my camera decided to die yesterday morning, so there are no extant photographs of me in my Miss Hannigan outfit. Damn. There was a wig involved, and a red bra, and Mardi Gras beads, and a flask. (Oh, and fair warning to all of you - should you ever find yourself in a situation in which you are expected to perform a largely impromptu 30's period piece musical with many of your friends, DO NOT listen to your significant other if he or she suggests that it would be a good idea to put REAL gin in your prop flask, as that would be "method acting." This, as it turns out, is a BAD IDEA.)

The man at the Auto-Body-Repair Shop said he'd lend me a courtesy car, and so he did. It was quite a nice car in some ways, apart from the rattles, the rust and the black smoke, but it was very small and had a ridiculously low bucket seat, the type that has a 6 inch ledge all round your thighs. With great difficulty I managed to manouevre myself into this ground-level driving seat, with my legs sticking horizontally forward into the well. I drove off, noticing as I did so that the car wouldn't go into second gear, and shortly afterwards, that the petrol gauge registered zero.
This view clearly has much wider significance. That it is at the edges of practically any sphere, from science to society, that diversity and innovation can be found. If you want to know what the next interesting thing will be, look to the edges of society where ideas clash and fuse. Permaculture itself has been pretty marginal for years – as has the eco-movement. Hippies have been quietly living in woods, harvesting water and composting poo for a long time – it is only now that those ideas are gaining weight in the mainstream.
In other words, the use of mantras are not God pleasing. God does not want anyone approaching Him in a senseless manner. He wants us to rightfully use the mind He created for us. To approach the most holy LORD of all, without using the gift of our full senses is an abomination and a gross sign of disrespect. It’s being silly — and we are not to act silly before God Almighty. That is sinful.
So, yesterday was my one year blogging anniversary! I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't even notice until late last night, by which time it was too late to get out the candles or whip up a cake.

Luckily, there is one male LPN on duty tonight to share the task. So I do what I am trained to do. I step up on that step stool and position my clasped hands just above the tip of the sternum. Whatever sleepiness that had settled in during my uneventful evening was now flushed away with a sea of adrenaline. I begin to throw all my weight into compressing this man's rib cage as I repeatedly check his pulse rate on the monitor. Too slow or too shallow and I'm not circulating enough blood.

My “Cornish” daughter was still in evidence today – this one may run and run. She laughs with us about it and to hear a nearly 8-year old answer everything with “…my lover” in a broad accent is funny.
The neighbor’s wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband’s mouth on the woman’s mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.

The housing payout shock comes after the hook-handed cleric won the right to keep his British ­citizenship. That victory raised fears he will be successful in his fight to avoid extradition to the US to face terror ­charges.
Well… It all started when I had a summer class with a group of High School girls. They kept talking about these dramas… How cute the men were .. How pretty the girls were… how they cried and laughed and just fell in love with every character. I thought awww… isn’t that cute. Their little obsession ..aww to be a teenager again. I figured I needed to stay hip and on top of the latest fads.. being a teacher… so I had better watch one so I can identify with my teenage girl students….Then OMG…I was hooked. Oh… they are like .. extended versions of our afterschool specials but with a little more humor and action.

Note that we plotted WKU first, followed by other member Sun Belt institutions. After that, the remaining Kentucky schools went on. Beyond that, I left it up to my son to ask questions and pick states until the session ended. This morning, he rolled out of bed, and his first words to me were, “What about Rhode Island?” So, we put URI’s baby blue and Providence’s black on the map before breakfast.

7. Some people will argue that Columbus Day is a day for recognition of Italians, an Italian Pride Day. Are Italians more worthy of recognitionthan other ethnic groups in this country we have proudly (?) nicknamed"The Melting Pot"? I have heard Italians say that Germans have Oktoberfest, the Irish have St. Patrick's Day and Mexicans have Cinco deMayo, but none of those are FEDERAL holidays. The only two ethnic groups worthy of recognition for their contributions and sacrifice in this land are those who were ALREADY HERE when the Europeans came and those who the Europeans BROUGHT HERE IN CHAINS. All other ethnic groups came here voluntarily. It was long overdue but African Americans finally got their holiday - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in January.... but Native Americans still don't have a holiday (urge your congressmen and women to support House Bill #167).

I quickly feel the unmistakeable snapping of ribs. My instant reaction is to let off the pressure but I know what has to be done. I continue to pound away while the doctor and nurses scramble with heart stimulating drugs and paddle shocks.

1995 – 2000: Around this time I developed asthma. I suppose that’s what all those bronchitis bouts were leading up to. Don’t worry. If you get this, the medications are very good now and you won’t be left like Che Guevara – alone and infirm in a tent, breathing into an empty, paper bag.

Audi’s Q3 is an interesting proposition. It’s aimed squarely at the BMW X1 and offers decent performance from a range of small petrol and diesel engines. Combining sporty premium SUV features in a compact body, the Q3 range starts at R370,000. It looks a little ordinary but its strength will be in ride, road holding and luxury interior. In a move that is most unlike Audi, there are some really funky colours available for the Q3. Google “Samoa Orange” if you don’t believe me.
I also purchased various dried herbs- these are often served on a Greek salad and mixes for making authentic tzatziki. And of course some real Feta cheese. Rich and creamy, salty, moist and slightly sour, semi-solid and certainly not hard and tasteless like you often find here.
As if these were not enough of a reason for both to remember the fixture, Alan Ball broke his leg by, in his own words, sitting on it. That injury kept the England midfielder out of his country’s end of season tour; the FA had to do something given England’s failure to qualify for the World Cup finals in West Germany that summer.
Handwriting: Part of the writing process is the ability to put words on paper. I know. Seems kinda obvious, right? But I've known a lot of parents (*points to self*) who expect their kids to journal and create and express their loving hearts out on paper before this skill has taken root. For some kids, the fine motor control just isn't there until age eight or so. Until then, don't feel like you're "cheating" if your child is verbalizing answers and sentences while you write them down.

Meanwhile, Greene was acting her heart out, doing the best she could with the character of a burned-out, child-like brown-acid-victim, who hysterically confesses to crimes she hasn’t committed in order to pad out the plot… but her refusal to burst into song, or call upon the “Pie Hole” gang to help solve the case definitely counts against her here. It was kinda cool to see her dressed as a hippie-ish “rock chick” though… more of that, please! Martin just seemed to be irritated by everyone and everything she encountered… presumably because she knows she’s the heroine of a murder mystery story, who can’t actually solve murder mysteries. That must be quite frustrating for her. Siemaszko was mostly there to react to exposition, but she managed to keep things fairly lively, so a tip of the hat to her for that… and I enjoyed Tina Lifford’s turn as ‘Bonnie’, the kindly owner of the B&B where the main characters take their regular coffee breaks. Other than that, everything was pretty yawn-worthy…

Although there is beautiful scenery, “Treasure Island” takes an unflinching look at the hardships of the seafaring life and features genuine tension. After the camp silliness of “Pirates of the Caribbean,” the authenticity is refreshing. As for all the stabbing and the like, well, as Long John Silver says, without violence or the threat of it, “other men take what’s yours and they live the life that should be yours.”

I also have no idea what she's eating, how much she's exercising, what she's learning, how she's learning, whether she's tidying up after herself, whether she's minding her manners, how she's spending her money, what music she's listening to, how much TV she's watching, whether she's brushing her teeth and wearing her retainers, and so on and so on. I don't ask, she doesn't offer, I just don't know.

I slammed on my brakes and surveyed the scene. I could hardly breathe and was momentarily overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of those few seconds. As a neighbor and Mr. Dorsey rushed to Michael’s aid I turned around and rode as fast as I could to his house, back up the hill on Rittenhouse and a right turn onto 48th Avenue. A block later as I turned left, onto our street, I passed Michael’s five-year old sister Sandy at the corner and shouted to her as I passed, “Michael’s been hit by a car!” Climbing the stairs to their front porch I pounded on the open screen door and shouted inside repeating to his parents what I had just told Sandy moments before. His dad rushed out the door and leaped from their porch yelling frantically “Where? Where?” I said “Down the hill on Rittenhouse Street!” I struggled on my bike to keep up with Michael’s father as he ran like a racehorse to his son’s side. Michael’s mother arrived soon behind as I watched from a short distance away.

The richness of the soup does creep up on you, and despite my confidence I could eat the entire bowl easily, I find I'm the victim of an embarrassing defeat. And I very rarely don't finish my meal.
We lost touch after that as we were living very different lives. One day as I was bravely pushing a double pram up a hill in my local shopping centre, his mother walked by. She stopped to chat and I proudly showed off my two babies. I asked how my ex was doing and she told me that he was about to be married for the second time, and that he had recovered from ‘his breakdown’. Immediately I remembered the shaking hands and the lost look in his eye. So the past had caught up with him after all.

Another big deal today, for me personally this time, was the arrival of my brand new birth certificate!! I've been waiting very (im)patiently for this since about July, I believe, and it's finally here!!! This completes all the really big personal information changes. Finally! I still have to take care of changing my name on my mortgage, as that's a bit of a hassle. But I'm going to get that done really soon now, as I believe I've found the documents I need to do this. I'm just about done with seeing that old name on any mail....

The first time I saw the end of Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse I felt I had been caught off guard, disoriented. The film ends with a string of desolate shots without any narrative progression, shown one after another. For most of the film we had been following the drama of the central characters. Suddenly, for the last seven minutes, the characters we have come to know have disappeared — and yet the film continues. We see deserted streets, shadows, anonymous strangers. Without the characters to ground us in story, the presence of the camera itself seems stronger. We become aware of it as an apparatus, a seeing-device that acts as its own separate entity. There is camera movement (panning, following a figure walking on a street) which suggests that something is about to be revealed; it seems Antonioni is trying to tell us something. There are some wide, long takes from above that slowly pan around as if surveying the streets. Trees rustle in the wind. A man in a suit rounds a corner. A toddler looks up at his mother. A close up of a man’s earlobe. A stream of water flows into the gutter. “Yes, what is it Antonioni?” I remember thinking, “What are you trying to show us?” I was searching for meaning, for story. A streetlamp burns brightly. The music crescendos. The film is over. There is an elegance to this sequence that I cannot quite explain.

So after all this time, I'm still here at a day shy of 38 weeks. Baby has moved head down and into birth position (though is not well engaged in the pelvis yet), and is healthy as can be or so say the tests. The last growth scan indicated a 7+ pound infant and my new doctor cheerfully informed me that if I go to 40 weeks, we may have a 9-pounder on our hands. I did not find that amusing.
Use any size cutter you want, but make sure to pack them in your pan tightly and let them rise a long time, until they are doubled. I let mine rise for hours in an oven that I preheated to 250 F and then shut off. These biscuits are not quick to make, for sure! Howeverm the dough can be made a head and refrigerated for up to a week for even better flavor.

They've never really done one before and I have to say, this one was quite a doozy! Our backyard is right at the tee box of a golf course, so they sat in our yard and caught all the golfers passing. At 25 cents a cup (and they sold some cookies for 50 cents each) $15 total is not a bad profit! They were stoked. And wanted to do it again the next day. I told them they couldn't or the city might shut them down for making too much money. :)
He could also see Tanner, his German Shepard, still asleep on his pillow over next the couch, probably because the damn dog was as drunk as he was from drinking beer last night. The dog had the strange habit of watching tourists and when one would leave the table he or she was sitting at, quickly run up, knock the bottle to the floor, and begin lapping of the spilled liquid. It was a trick Jack and other locals enjoyed since Tanner had the uncanny ability to target the most obnoxious person of whatever tourist group happened to be visiting at that time, usually a white, middle-aged American male.
What do you do for fun (I.e. Hobbies, leisure time, etc.)
I suspect the days in June were very rare for me indeed, as they seem to pass as if in slow motion. Too hot weather, too early at times, and then the perfect summer days that one wants never to end. And then there is the intensity of July! Is there enough iced-tea? Are the white shirts cool enough? Are the plants on the terrace getting enough water? July seems to ask a lot of us. Even getting to vacation locations has its imperatives.

With a career total of more than 100 films, Bette changed the way Hollywood looked at actresses. In 1977, she was the first woman to be honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also the first woman to be president of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. At the age of 75, Bette had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. Nine days later, she suffered a stroke. Despite her failing health, she continued to act until her death. Bette passed away October 6, 1989 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.

60,000 - The number of people in Zimbabwe now infected by cholera, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Cholera has now claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people in Zimbabwe. The epidemic of the disease, has been fueled by the collapse of Zimbabwe’s water, sanitation and health systems. Many hospitals have shut down and most towns suffer from poor water supply, broken sewers and uncollected waste. With the upcoming rainy season even more infections could occur as water sources become contaminated.

Fast-forward to December. By the time I'm on my way to work, the sun has barely risen, and chances are I'm trudging through rain, slush, or usually a mix of both.

Well, it's empty and filled with remnants of fall leaves, making the ground slippery and forcing anyone to look at their feet rather than at the sky.

Make Real Estate Work for the City – especially in the cases of cities like Baltimore and Detroit which have declined from larger populations, there is a huge untapped potential in the vacant housing and real estate for economic development. First, rehabilitation of vacant housing and real estate can be the foundation for a direct job creation program with extremely valuable production. Second, selling that housing cheaply (in the case of Baltimore for a dollar) or just giving it away to working people literally spreads the wealth while expanding the city’s tax base. As occupancy rates in these properties rise, so does the value of housing and land the city owns – building up the Metropolitan Reserve Banks in turn. Third, it can provide a real solution for homelessness by just giving people a key to an apartment and access to facilities.

Yard work isn’t all that Greg has been up to lately; he’s also been keeping up with his freshwater tanks. We got rid of the saltwater a while back, but we’ve still got the other two. He completely re-did the smaller one this past weekend because it had an algae problem. He put new substrate in the bottom, bought new plants, washed out the tank completely, and even gave the fish some new decorations. He’s also ordered a new bulb to help with the plants and algae. We’re hoping the new additions/upgrades keep the algae in check because the tank is looking great at the moment.
So I've made the move across the country - I actually made the move in June, but I wouldn't say that I've really settled in until now. I've got a job, I just moved into a new apartment in Portland, and I really feel like I'm beginning my life out here.

Families often ask me how i can get their child to do something they can't.. well i have limited emotional investment ( not MY child) and i listen and observe the behavior so i understand the communication. If you react rather than respond you are liable to misunderstand and the behavior continues. We need to be the problem solvers we want our children to grow up to be. They need to test the rules, we need to set them. It is our job as parents to be completely present all the time, ( which is not always doable). It is necessary to be all Parent and only some person when the children are under 5. I tell parents that there is a big P and a little t in parent... we must embrace that big P in order for the adult child to walk away from us at 18 or 20 and be independent and ultimately successful.

The Good: A must read. Stassen accomplishes much with few pages (less than 80!) and few words. He tells of life before and after the Genocide; he includes the various factions and entities present, from the UN peacekeeping force to the Rwandan Patriotic Front to the Interahamwe. The brevity helps; too many words would drown this story. The simplicity emphasizes the horror.

Hyun Suk confronts M2 with the video. They all wonder how it got there and Hyun Suk asks if they’re the ones in the video. Jae Ha is about to stand but Seung Yeon stops him. Team Leader Han takes them to task and Hyun Sung speaks up-it was them. Chang Min tells him to be specific-as in who was and who wasn’t there. Hyun Suk is shrewd and asks Chang Min what he wants to say but Jae Ha speaks up, wanting to take responsibility. Chang Min scoffs at him and Hyun Suk sees it. The team sits outside later-minus Jae Ha wondering who took the video and Tae Gun rightly points out-anyone could’ve taken the movie but not everyone could have delivered it to Hyun Suk with a look at Chang Min. Chang Min owns up to it. They wonder how he could betray the team and if he had that little confidence in himself. Chang Min scoffs, at least he’s not lying like someone else, with a look at Seung Yeon! In Hyun Suk’s office, Hyun Suk asks to hear the reason Jae Ha went on stage without the company’s permission. Did he go to earn money or he wanted to show the world his talent? Jae Ha tells them he needed the money so he took the gig and everyone just helped him. Hyun Suk asks, is it for the same reason you go out with your guitar every night? Team Leader Han is stunned. Jae Ha has a part time gig and Hyun Suk knew it? At Jae Ha’s response, Hyun Suk smiles and tells him it’s good he’s honest and confident. Meanwhile, Woo Hyun is on his way back to the company from the airport. Everyone’s still pissed at Jae Ha who comes back and tells them it’ll be fine, he’ll take the blame. Seung Yeon tells Chang Min he shouldn’t have betrayed the team like this and he rounds back at her, however anyone else says things, she has no right to condemn him. He asks her if she thinks she has the right to be on the team and turns to Ji Woo too who tries to defend Seung Yeon. Before a fight breaks out, Team Leader Han walks in.

The way out of impossibilities is to fully realize that it is an illusion, perpetuated by our own attachment to an erroneous perception of reality. When we notice we are feeling mired and stuck, we can challenge the impossibilities by asking our self: “Is it true that I am not loved?” When we are open, ready and willing to release attachments to the impossibilities, the answer becomes: “No! The very essence of life itself is love. And I am of life. I am of Nature. I too am the stuff that is Nature. I am connected to everything, everywhere, always. I am love!”

It is something I want to talk about, as I had a conversation about it today, and I’ve had a lot of really interesting conversations about it in the past. And especially because I don’t really know what I think of it.
Parents were invited again, and I put in a brief appearance with Possum. We didn't stay long because Mousie seemed to think she had to sit with us, but we could see she wanted to join in with the dancing that was going on over at the other side of the room. I knew we made the right decision when we looked back through the window and saw her happily doing the conga with her friends.
Today in German-speaking Europe many families set up an Advent wreath, or Adventskranz on the first Advent Sunday (the fourth before Christmas) to start off the Advent season. The picture on the left shows a typical evergreen Advent wreath with its four candles, one for each week of Advent. Traditional families gather around the wreath on each Advent Sunday to light the next candle and sing Christmas carols. This was even more important in the past, when the Christmas tree was usually reserved for a special unveiling only on Christmas Eve. Until then, the Advent wreath provided the evergreen look and aroma in the house.

We crossed the Stari Most to Coppersmiths’ Street (Kujundziluk). Lined with vendors selling souvenirs made by local artists and coppersmiths, many items portrayed the Old Bridge. We visited several of the little shops. One of the coppersmiths we spoke with asked where we were from and then proudly told us he had a daughter who lives in the United States.We bought a few souvenirs for ourselves and family (later, we would see all the same kinds of souvenirs in Istanbul (read about the trip here).

After having a rough arrival to Melbourne, with housing drama, I was very excited to take a few days from the apartment search and relax in true Aussie fashion on the beach. I made my trek to the university a whopping 9 kilometer walk to campus (just another incentive to find a new place to live). I made some fast friends waiting for the trip leaders to organize the buses and we set off for an adventure on the Great Ocean Road.
I know I haven't been around much. Preoccupied. You see, in just two weeks from today I'll be driving back to the place I spent four of the best years of my life. Oddly enough, I haven't been back since.
That is the crown of it that means those who are thinking that maybe one day I will grow less, they are wasting their time.
Of course, these were two separate photos--from two different homes. I didn't think I'd ever find a blacktop driveway that led to a brick house--a house with dormers and lots of trees.
With the cooling weather I've sought to make some comfort food - a simple borlotti bean ragu. At its heart is a soffritto - onion, celery, carrot - to which I've added red capsicum and grated zucchini. Red capsicum when slowly cooked adds a lovely sweetness to the dish and grated zucchini thickens the sauce and makes it almost creamy.

Like communism or socialism, capitalism is a word with objective, specific meaning. The French word “laissez-faire” literally means “let us alone.” According to Ayn Rand, the greatest contemporary philosopher who offered the best defense of this most moral economic system, capitalism simply means “a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.” Sison is right in saying that capitalism is about greed and self-interest. This is because the moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that it represents the best way to achieve the common good. Under a true capitalist system, the achievement of common good is merely a secondary consequence.

We used to say that we would struggle, fight, and wage Jihad, until we regain our rights, because what was taken by force will only be restored by force, and what was taken by the sword will not be restored by the pen or the word. Unfortunately, however, we have abandoned this, and we have taken the path of the so-called “peaceful solution.” We have made one concession after another.

What made me so sorrowful? It was pointed out to me that my heart is not perfect and the truth of it makes me mourn. It’s what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING and it cuts cruel and deep, “Father, please cover my imperfect heart with your breastplate of righteousness”. Can I bear the Kings armor till he purifies my heart?
My husband will add some things from time to time and I will always seek God and my husband’s approval before posting anything here. I want to make sure it is from God and not my flesh. Now I know why God has been stressing only posting His Word – Truth and to be prepared.

On the way home from our favourite farm on Tuesday we stopped off for a wander around a small town. In a shop window were a row of Queenie's, all slowly waving with glazed expressions. Being suckers for plastic stuff that does nothing more than make us laugh meant we needed one so we rushed in to bag our own Queenie. Now she sits on our windowsill watching and waving while we do kitchen stuff. Our favourite plastic friend was a chubby grinning chinese boy who sat astride a pink dolphin and spun from the ceiling playing plinky music. He fell to pieces a long while back now and I still miss him.

Of course, if they were forced to read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," there would be a hell of a lot more suicide bombers than there are now. Jeez, that book did go on. I thought a better name for it would have been "Location, Location, Location: and what they ate while they were there," but I guess that title is not as catchy. There were not enough guns or germs, and steel barely got a mention. What did get mentioned, repeatedly, was the phrase "food production," approximately 1,296,379 times. McDonald's does not talk about food production that much, for Christ's sake. Then again, McDonald's doesn't serve food, so maybe that's why.

27. Evangelista - In Animal Tongue
Homosexuals have chosen the word “gay,” a word that means “happy” or “a lively, merry mood” or “bright, showy,” to describe their lifestyle. In homosexuality’s portrayal in the media and in its publicity by its advocates, that’s what it can appear to be. A fun-loving, free lifestyle. Yet this is only a mirage. Over the years, in every interaction I have had with a person calling their lifestyle “gay,” that same angry fire that my bookstore acquaintance had could be seen in their eyes . Whether it’s been a one-time opportunity to interact with someone who has identified himself as gay or the longer-term weekly counseling of a man who claimed hundreds of partners (and looked as if it were true), a below-the-surface, seething anger has always been present.

I would definitely like to know more about it.

The connection between us it seems
Once I was here I needed to taka a taxi to the confernce center. I had google mapped it, and it was about a 5 minute drive. So I gave the address to the driver, who seemed to know wehre it was but then proceeded to get lost and drive around for about 30 minutes looking for it. It turned into a very expensive taxi ride. I paid it, but I wish now I'd been a bit more assertive about saying that I shouldn't have been charged so much.
Once Isaac is released from the gurney he's been strapped to, he's forced to flee the ward as Necromorphs jump out from around corners and burst through ducts. Cue the frantic escape sequence. But here's the fun part: he's still tied up in a straight jacket. A prompt instructs us to hold down the left shoulder button to run. The straight jacket conceit makes this particular piece of scaffolding feel natural while also playing on that horror movie trope, the powerless protagonist.
So...the next time you look at those wonderful fall leaves or pick up a bright red maple leaf or wonder at the beauty of a yellow hickory leaf - remember how those wonderful colors were produced - and realize how magical a plant really is to the planet. Not because of the colors of the leaves or how it looks in our landscape, but how it keeps us alive by producing all of that sugar and oxygen that keeps us eating and breathing every day.
Wait wait wait... what does Star Wars have to do with any of this? Apparently, no movie like Meteor is going to admit wanting to jump on the same bandwagon as George Lucas and company, but it would be idiotic of it not to think that any geek high off of the adventures of a galaxy far far away wouldn't want to keep the intergalactic ball rolling by signing up for an adventure that involves NASA, rockets, desperate scientists and the fate of mankind. Maybe Neame and his crew thought that Meteor was the anti-Star Wars; science fiction for the thinking set.
The less you can explain the questions of your purpose and existence the more you come up with a ridiculous analysis for life and your left with no reason for existing or for life at all. The cycle continues. The more hateful against anything good and morally right you get. The more you hate those stupid Christians that claim God exists and that say there is a reason and purpose for your life .
During most races we see the mechanics make adjustments to the car during pitstops. During each stint radio communications between the driver and his race engineer will discuss the cars balance. Whether the car tends to oversteer or understeer. Since the ban on active technologies there’s little the teams can do to alter the car during the race. Currently only front wing adjustment, rear wing gurney removal and tyre pressures are easily changed during the hectic 3-4s pitstops.

What I wanted at TBEX was a session that presented the reality of writing as a profession, not as a quixotic pursuit or a weekend hobby or gap year boondoggle. Admittedly, I wanted this for myself as much as anything. Because I struggle with what I do (what is that, anyways?) all the time. I wanted to hear people who I think of as grown up, professional travel writers speak honestly about how they juggle all this stuff, how they manage to make it work. I’m always grateful for time with writers who will share, honestly, how they get by — a recent conversation revealed a writer’s need to sell multiple stories about one destination with every trip in order to make the travel pay off. “I can’t go just because I want to. I need to sell that story five times over to have it be worth my while.”
Both babies measured great - he's 1lb, 2oz and she's 15.9oz, which puts them right about at the 50th percentile. They had good fluid levels, solid heartbeats, and my bleed has officially absorbed!! YAHOOOO!!! I go back in 4 weeks and we'll tour the maternity ward and NICU then. I was so overwhelmed with joy that they looked so awesome! My mom came with me to the u/s and she loved every minute of it - it truly is so special to see them.

In the United Kingdom after days of obfuscation and half-denials the Prime Minister admits he did ride a horse loaned to a tabloid news editor he was friendly with by the police force that was investigating her newspaper.
I wanted to go with a vintage theme for Mum. Not saying she is old though! Just wanted something a bit nostalgic. It also took me out of my own comfort zone, as I don't normally do vintage! I loved using the Hat Pin (retired), and I have also used the Velvet Ribbon available in the new Summer Mini Catalogue. I didn't want cream though and dyed this ribbon, using my Night of Navy ink pad. I was surprised how beautifully this ribbon dyed up! Not at all patchy as I thought it would.
I know from my own experience that my horse (who currently schools Fourth Level and some of the Prix St. George) cannot school in the arena more than three days per week. (And he’ll tell you if you ask!) So to keep him fresh, interested, and fit, we spend the three days hacking out, doing trot and canter sets in the lanes, or long-lining, another three days doing a more traditional schooling routine, and then he gets one day off per week. And I generally find that I get my best, show-quality work from him on the day after he’s either rested or hacked – particularly if we struggled with a problem or issue in our last training session prior to the rest day. It’s like the time away has shown him what he needs to do to get it right (and me too!), so with a little bit of cogitation and fresh muscles, it’s all right there.
Article 8 does not always work though. A paedophile illegal immigrant, Zulfar Hussain, has finally been thrown out of Britain after a long court battle in which he claimed that his deportation would breach his human rights. This is good news, but Hussain represents only a drop in the multicultural ocean and cost the taxpayer over £100,000 in his welfare funded legal battle to remain in Blackburn, Lancashire.
So our unique perceptions of the world we experienced together were destined to be endlessly different, destined to be unrelated. And no matter what I said to her, she would never understand that what I write on these pages, when I say that I have no home and that I am endlessly tormented by the constant need to leave everything behind and travel, to give up the entire world I’ve created and move on to something new, that this isn’t in any way a sad thing in my eyes.

Here comes another rant from me, THE CHILDLESS MOMMY BLOGGER, as I’ve taken to calling myself. You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below.

Straight away, one has to think about Mycoplasma pneumonia. People at highest risk for mycoplasma pneumonia include those living or working in crowded areas such as schools, Army barracks and homeless shelters. The incubation time for Mycoplasma pneumonia is one to 4 weeks. This means that it takes one to 4 weeks after catching the bug to become ill. A bit like with chickenpox, which has an incubation time of one to 3 weeks.

Lancôme had offered the lower court an expert report of a physical-chemical analysis of the two perfumes. The report concluded that, given the fact that there are hundreds of different components that could have been used, it is highly unlikely that it is a coincidence that Kecofa used 24 of the exact components out of the 26 in total used by Lancôme. The 25th ingredient was a cheaper substitute of the remaining Trésor component. Since the expertise of the report was not denied by Kecofa, nor the accusation of copying, the Court concluded that Kecofa must have copied Lancôme’s product and therefore violated Lancôme’s copyrights.

My cough has become a part of who I am. My roommates know when I get home because they hear me coughing when I walk through the door. It tells them.... "HONEY I'M HOME!" My friends hear me coming wherever I go (though its tough to sneak up on them in that respect). To me, some days, my cough isn't something gross and disgusting, its just something I do every day. It's as natural as breathing.

Caracole is a new company, but like so many in Belgium, the residents inhabit an ancient brewery. Located in Wallonia, near the French border in Falmignoul, Brasserie Moussoux was founded ten years before America was born. In the year the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the name was changed to Brasserie Lamotte before eventually becoming Caracole in the year Clinton was first elected. The brewery is proud of its artisinal heritage, and still brews the old-fashioned way, over a wood fire.

And the knowledge that 24 weeks isn't a magical marker at which all problems vanish is there. I cling to that date, but I am aware of the real statistics. I know the outcomes, and I know that babies still die, that there are still very real and present risks, and longterm complications, and so I am not content with that date either. But at the least, that gives us a chance.
So, slowly, slowly, I learnt that the best treatment for me was simplicity. No more, no less. Good, healthy food, cooked from scratch. No toxic chemicals, no pointless additives, not even thickeners if a reduction will do. No neon drinks or fizzy pop. No synthetic creams or juice "drinks". Add in a dose of sunshine and I feel zingy and alive. Sunshine, fresh air and simple, freshly cooked food.
Examples of physics abound in the natural world. Many animals and plants utilize the natural laws of our universe to live, reproduce, and obtain food. It has been known for many years that bats use high frequency sound waves to echo-locate insects on nightly forays in search of food. What has recently been discovered is a plant that actively encourages bats to drink nectar from it's fruit, and spread pollen in the process by forming echo-genic leaves designed to allow bats an easier time in finding the fruiting portions of the plant. Isn't life marvelous?
Whereas the angels depicted by Giotto and earlier painters had their wings fixed in place because paint can’t move, Guy made the conscious choice (albeit, the easier one) to keep that immobility while allowing the angels themselves to fidget and wander.

Darren Richmond! Well, HE certainly pulled himself together in a hurry, didn’t he? He even made a joke when Jamie was tying up his shoes, and again later to Gwen. I was happy to see Gwen back, actually. It’ll be interesting to see if she and Richmond and Jamie can all just work together, but so far it looks to be going okay. Richmond handled himself perfectly in the interview with the nosey lady, and it looks like Gwen at least feels she can help him win. Actually, I think maybe all three of them think she could be the one to put them over the top – if anyone can.
Not all fear is bad. In fact, fear can be very good & right. The whole subculture centered around 'No Fear' I find to be idiotic actually. Some things should be feared. Crazy man has a gun: let's go walk up to him and call him a wus because we have no fear? That's not just lack of fear that's lack of intelligence. You'll soon be dead: evolution at work if you haven't bred yet. So fear isn't universally bad. It is a survival instinct, and an important one.
The chronic behaviour pattern has to be procrastination. There are some things that continue to escape my best intentions. If there ever was a miscast accountant, it’s me. I really struggle with my own paperwork. My taxes aren’t done, but I have a refund coming so I don’t HAVE to file them. Gonna try and do that this weekend. I am also a, shall we say, less than stellar housekeeper. I think I’d probably be more comfortable in a tidier home. This pattern can be broken…. I just need to examine my motives and

I think as a parent of a child with a disability there is sometimes the tiniest little check, a hesitation when I think about the future. It’s not the gasping for air, punch to the gut it used to be, but sometimes there’s a little catch in the throat as I wonder “Is it realistic?” This is often accompanied by some momma guilt (Do I have the right to wonder what’s realistic?) and some self-doubt (Do I not believe enough in my child?).

Happy New Year everyone. Such a cliche yet.... 2012 sounds good to me. Ever the cockeyed optimist, I've scanned the headlines this morning, the world is in a mess, killing over religion, tribal warfare continues unabated, and yet I still have a deep seated notion that this year may bring some respite from the economic trials of the last several years.
But I’m waiting to actually finish something (and get some fun ‘after’ pics), so those projects will have to wait.
I honor those of you who took the time to post comments on Facebook, after reading my post… your efforts helped me to gain additional perspective… and your words will remain as an inspiration to all those who read them… I am forever grateful for your expressions of love and support…. I really do have the most amazing friends!
So what now for Austria. The ability to tip the scales of power lies in the hand of the Nationalist Parties and given that the "established" traitor parties have said they will not enter into another coalition, anything is now possible.
“I don’t mean the penny. Don’t you feel as if someone’s looking after us?”
It all begins by loving God. It starts with loving God. If we love God, and if we are born of God we will love God, then we cannot help but love those who are also born of him. It is simply incompatible with our heritage and parentage to not love those who belong to the family of God. There should be no civil war in the family of God. But sometimes it seems that the family of God is so fractured that it is perpetually defeated. It makes one wonder how often the enemy capitalizes on this? It makes one wonder what those literally not born of God think about those who claim to be born of God. What sort of family do they believe us to be? What sort of fractured family are we?
Why did I choose HS'ing? I found myself giving my best to other peoples children and having a short fuse with mine. I didn't like it at all...one bit. I wanted to give my best to my children. They deserved it and still do. I knew that if I could spend the majority of my day educating other people's children and loving it (which I did), that I would love it that much more to be able to give that to my babies. I do! I love teaching them. I love it when they teach me, because they do.
By 1953, he began to make collages, which soon became the precursors of pop art, incorporating cigarette logos, images from fan magazines. He coined a phrase for them - "moticos" - and carried them around New York, showing them to strangers in public places and asking for their reactions and recording them (most of this work has been destroyed or recycled).
Why not to watch: It’s a snuff film with a budget.
Seriously, I want to help you guys out.
All of this just confirms my believe that whilst this coalition may repeal a fews laws which I didn't like they are just papering over the cracks of our problem.

Being a quilter, I can't resist the allure of vintage wooden bobbins and spools, and one dealer had a terrific assortment of vintage beehive bobbins—just 50 cents a piece! The larger bobbin pictured was only a $1. I have seen these go for as much as $10 a piece but I suspect their actual value is somewhere in between.

This might be a more exciting "faux-liday" for me than Cinco de Mayo. While I do like tequila (in fact, it's one of the few hard liquors I truly enjoy drinking), I love, love, love my Belgian beers. What a better reason the celebrate them!

I just need to get Kaitlin's information to send her the Cricut Cartridge seen in my blog candy picture- Congratulations! I hope she enjoys it.
Their relationship was not only funny, especially when John would get over-protective and jealous even with his best friend Will, it was adorable and passionate. One of those passionate parts I loved was when John found Meg in a car with Eric, her non-boyfriend boyfriend, and his reaction, a mix of hurt and anger, had me swooning.
There are, of course, plenty of other organizations that cater specifically to service travel-minded retirees–what, and where, are some of your favorites?

The weather forecast threatens more rain tomorrow, which I hope will subside before the afternoon, as I plan to visit Jardin Japonese and Jardin Zoologico. Wouldn't be much fun in the freezing rain or wind. And in any case, I will be more prepared for the weather tomorrow! First thing I will buy in the morning will be a thermos and a set of Yerba Mate. I think I've grown addicted to the bitter stuff, and I can't wait to have my own thermos to carry around like those old men of Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile.

Even though I have a new computer (which is why I've been playing so much Starcraft II and Football Manager 2011 instead of working on my own game), I still use my old laptop when I'm working on Sore Losers: Riot Grrrl (the game I'm developing). I do this because I use MS Paint to create the graphics for this game and the new MS Paint has an annoying habit of changing the colour depth of PNGs when you save them, which causes many a problem if you're using RPGMaker 2003.
Someone who frequently uses the internet for social purposes can validate from one experience or the other the phenomenon of online activism: they come across a particular ideal, message, or situation that has been conveyed to them by other internet users. More often than not these “messages” will resound a cause that is meant to address and expose certain injustices occurring throughout the world. What Sandor Vegh does in his article “Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests against the World Bank”, is attempts to distinguish between different forms of activism online (as the name suggests), hacking vs. cyberterrorism being one of the main topics of discourse. He then further elaborates on the issue by analyzing what reactions can or should be justified in lieu of a hacker/cyberterrorist campaign.
It would very neat at this point to say I started writing The New Industrial Revolution as a result of this build up of anxiety about the world economy and how to get it in better shape.
1994 was supposed to be change for the better, freedom for all. Where is that freedom? How have things gotten any better?� It hasn’t.� The fact is things have gotten worse.� Not just here in South Africa, but all over the world including the land of the free and home of the brave.� I started reading an e-book by an ex-South African who has been living in UK for the past 12 years, and it is a great place to start to get information about political South Africa and its place in the global conspiracy.� Many of us know that the South African government, the ANC is incredibly corrupt. My question is what will change if, lets say, the DA comes into power?� Im sure there would be change, but would it be enough?� Mandela had such great aspirations and ideas to liberate South Africa and its inhabitants.� What happened to the freedom charter? What happened to those ideals and ideas?� We need to understand that its global politics, every country is at the mercy of those with money, and unfortunately South Africa still owes the IMF a lot of money.� We currently owe approximately $109.4 BILLION.
Besides taking the opportunity to vent about a situation that I find very frustrating, this story seems to me worth telling because it provides something of a parable of the contradictions involved in being a professor of popular music. It's my job to try to cultivate a more sophisticated understanding of popular music and the larger media system through which it's produced. But to do so, I need resources of a sort that are pretty common outside the academic setting but far less so inside. Adding to that, it's important for me not to take the supposedly inevitable tide of technological "progress" as a given. Just because the corporations that earn enormous profits from the production of new technologies have deemed some particular item or format to be obsolete doesn't mean that we should all follow suit. Vinyl may be, in the end, just another commodity item, no more no less, but it was also a dominant form in which people experienced music for the better part of a century, and the notion that we should all dispense with our vinyl archives because of changing media is folly.

In addition to the death benefit, living benefits life insurance policies offer the trifecta of terminal, chronic and critical illness financial protection for insureds and their families. Used as an alternative to traditional long term care insurance, indexed universal life insurance products with living benefits can provide dollars for chronic illness with the added benefit of cash value buildup. Clients who balk at paying a hefty LTC insurance premium may be more than willing to purchase a living benefits index universal life policy as it can provide significant cash value if the policy is surrendered.
In our twisted society the demands of our parents to achieve, to surpass, to excel, to get more material stuff than your fellow neighbour are all seen as commonly accepted things...? In Buddhism, they teach that 'material possessions, kill the soul.'
Seaweed: It wasn't until recently that I discovered how much Heidi and Piper like seaweed. I've tried it and find it tastes too much like sushi without being sushi for me to fully enjoy it. But for them, a whole package is just not enough. They literally stuff these sheets into their mouths while simultaneously asking for more. They're worth a try, if you can find them, and they are also one of the more healthier snack options out there.
Our health care system is in ruins, and only those who have their heads in the sand can't see that. On several levels: loss of work force, cost of medical treatment, cost of insurance, an aging populous, this current "system" stands to wreck our country faster than Social Security, taxes, terrorists, or any competing cause. If we don't address it, it's going to be horribly ironic that the America we think we know will be destroyed by a social issue that right-wingers refused to acknowledge. Get off your high horse and bring solutions to the table. (And by the way, the most plausible solution here is to make health care insurance the responsibility of individuals, not employers. But like so many things, we all know that's not going to happen, either.)
Here's a clip of the opening credits. It's just...so odd. I can't look away.
We did learn a lot about the fort (not a walled fort like most of them), and the Buffalo Soldiers who were stationed there. This is a monument of Corporal Clinton Graves, one of the soldiers who fought the Apaches and received a Medal of Honor.
i'd just seen some cute drinking glasses and jars with mini chalkboards for labeling at world market, and thought that i could perhaps cover up the red floral vines with some chalkboard paint and use the jars in my "new" kitchen (i really changed a lot of stuff up!).
What really pisses me off, is that it has taken until now for the people of this once great nation to take a stand, and that the stand is being taken against white, Christian Europeans. If, instead of Italian and Polish workers, these jobs had been given to non-European immigrants from Africa, Asia or the Caribbean would the Politically correct brain washing have kicked in, and would those now protesting stayed at home to watch “Hustle” or some other Common Purpose approved propaganda with a take away curry. I hope not, but I fear so.

A week or so ago, my wife brought home two French movies on DVD, OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and its sequel, OSS 117: Lost in Rio. They’re spy spoofs, a kind of French Austin Powers series, starring the delightful Jean Dujardin (he won this year’s Best Actor Oscar for The Artist) as the hopelessly out of touch, (almost) hilariously bigoted French spy OSS 117.

Don’t be afraid to look around at different stores or internet retailers. Look to see what the prices are at each store before you decide to make a purchase. If you are looking online, don’t forget to add taxes and shipping/handling to your final cost. Amazon and NewEgg might have the same product at the same price, but if Amazon is giving you free shipping, then in the end that is who you should go to.
In 2002, the American Association of Poison Control Centers launched a nationwide toll-free hotline for prevention and treatment of poisonings. The number is (800) 222-1222. In the case of any suspected poisoning emergency, they can be contacted 24 hours a day.

Growing up I have such fond memories of both of my grandmothers.
About the book -
My last dog, Chase, was a golden retriever (or as I referred to him “Love of my life”). He ate up the adoration. Long before he was fully grown, it became clear he did not realize he was a dog, and I wasn’t going to break it to him…considering I was the one feeding him off my plate and baby-talking to my “Chaser-doodle-puppy-wuppy”. This quintessential family pet was the constant sidekick everyone gathered around at each soccer game to pet and spoil.
Anyhow...

Besides, it was time to leave Socorro. Just before he skipped town, some copper swore he saw little green men over a hill on top of a mesa. G-men, the Air-Force and every hack reporter from La La Land to the Big Apple swarmed into the small town.

Never changing who,
What struck me about the two trips being so close together is the clear level of white, entitled anger that permeated fading-Midwestern-resort. The vacationing people on the island were a) clearly quite well off financially and b) supposed to be enjoying a leisurely holiday. Nonetheless, it seemed like every time I turned around all I heard was people obsessing about how they thought Obama had done them wrong and how this country was “on the road to socialism.” They were also numerous, numerous anti-immigrant statements. This occurred despite the fact that the very resort that was catering to them at that very moment clearly depended on immigrant labor. It was astounding to me that an entire island’s worth of people who are so fortunate (especially in a region with the highest unemployment) could continue to demand more and more of the pie. They have everything that they could possibly want and yet it simply wasn’t enough. Much to my horror, they also managed to say that every African-American waiter who served them “looked like Obama.” I find it unlikely that I will ever return to fading-Midwestern-resort.

This is just a glimpse of my crazy brain. Needless to say I was in an unhealthy state regarding my relationship with food, one that had been taking place for several years prior to coming to Portland.
Our lab instructor told us that most patients won't need help with perineal care and prefer to take care this themselves. As our course packet helpfully suggests, "Most patients understand what is meant is the nurse simply says, 'I'll give you a washcloth to finish your bath.'" Later I was saying that suggested phrasing is helpful. Of course someone was going to hear that as suggestive phrasing. Hilarity ensued.

I wanted to make a mini version of the tart, I've always liked mini everything as I think it is prettier. The tart dough I had was from Pierre Herme recipe, same one as I used in this lemon tart. I used the same recipe for the passion fruit cream, just substituted passion fruit for the lemon. As expected, the resulting cream is bursting with passion fruit flavor and as smooth as it can be. I made the leftover joconde and cream and raspberry jelly to make the cake version of it and it is equally good!
Yet, this simple concept of right and wrong gets muddled by differing ideas about religion, patriotism, economics and many other divisions. The “just war” rule has crumbled under the ambitions of empires throughout history. The American-led Anglo Saxon empire is no different.

Or it might mean having a serious go at self-publishing. Many are seizing the opportunity to publish or re-publish their own books. For some, this is a bold and exciting step forward. For others it may be a last resort. Either way, some authors are beginning to do very well from it.

We want to you share this special character or book/series with us and your followers. Tell us about them: share pictures, passages, quotes, excerpts, etc. Then offer that book as a giveaway to share the love. We all want the chance to be besotted, carried away, and/or charmed. So, introduce us to that special character that has left you love-struck.

I had some goals to workout just as much and eat well on my week off Feb. weight loss challenge. I however did not stick to them. I let stress get to me and had a few days where I ate some junk food and drank a couple sodas. I also only exercised about three of the days. I surprisingly lost a half a pound still even on my week off. So I am thinking building some muscle doing more strength training is helping me burn calories easier. I am totally ready for this challenge again. So I am going to blog once again while I am doing the 21 Day Mommy Bloggers Weight Loss Challenge, sponsored by Dustin Maher.

Morello: What was yesterday?
One of the many reasons I started this blog was to connect with people and share stories and info about running. It’s mostly been one-way but I get that people are scared to share their stories and comments. I get it, I was like that. But this little exercise in public writing has helped me quite a bit. And I’ve connected with people who I wouldn’t have otherwise. So it’s not all bad!
And that strength is even more available to us today, because God has expressed his character most vividly in Christ (Heb. 1:1-3).
Yet, ironically as Jamaican sprinters are finding success by flocking to their country's top sprint coaches in droves, we here in the US seem to be slipping as our athletes are running the other way from our top coaches! Spearmon had great success with Braumann, but left to train with his father. Carter began having success with Holloway (in spite of injury) but left. Wariner was seemingly on his way to the WR in the 400 but left Hart - and my grapevine says that Sanya Richards is considering a similar move. Does anyone think that the Lakers will be getting rid of Phil Jackson any time soon? I didn't think so.
Luke kept trying to fall over. No matter how many times we told him to stay put, he just couldn't keep his feet in the boat. Then, he noticed that he had splashed a bunch of water into the boat so he grabbed our DRY towel and began sopping up the water. Aaggh! We tried to explain to him that it was OK for there to be water in the bottom of the boat. I should have just thrown him overboard...

I eventually ended up running the 2010 Chicago Marathon and the 2011 Chicago Marathon as well – both for charities. I figured that if was going to run, I might as well run for a great cause, since I knew it drove and inspired me. I eventually ended up loving distance running, mainly because I’m able to run free and enjoy and appreciate the world around me, not to mention, God gave me the ability to do so, and I don’t want to take that for granted.

At the guide’s feet was a thin, white line, perhaps two inches wide, that was comprised of some kind of granular powder. It stretched off in either direction, curving away into the fiery haze of the silent, dead wood. “Is that salt?” Stolik asked, nudging it with his toe.

I wonder what Kevin Donlan has in mind when he speaks of “a new model for a new day.” I have finished a careful study of the new Rwandan canons and the Anglican Mission canonical charter. They evidence the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law in language, doctrine, norms, and principles. In a number of places the Rwandan canons clearly are repudiation of the Thirty-Nine Articles and of authentic historic Anglicanism, and embrace in their place the dogmas of the Council of Trent. The provisions governing the relationship of the Rwandan Primate with Anglican Primatial Vicar Chuck Murphy are based upon the provisions of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law governing the relationship of the Pope to lesser bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. This causes me also to wonder what part Donlan himself played in their formulation.

So my wish for today to Jan Marie is to have a day of happiness, laughter, relaxation, and so much fun you can't see straight!

“Amen, amen I say to you, the eighth day will be the day of great rejoicing and gladness, for Satan’s long reign of terror shall be finally over and My Son shall establish His glorious reign in your midst. Yes, creation will once again belong rightfully to Me, and persons shall live in accord with My holy and divine Will. Love shall be the law of the land as brother will assist brother, sister shall assist sister, and holiness, humility, simplicity and justice shall reign supreme. This shall be the new era. This shall constitute the new heavens and the new earth, and it shall only be in the light of My divine Truth that you shall begin to understand how ensnared the world, at this present time, truly is. It will only be after the victory has been won, that the collective eyes of humanity shall be opened wide for the first time, like a new-born babe, realizing that it is finally free of its tremendous burden of sin and death. For I Am Who Am and all of these things shall come to pass. So shall it be, for I Am the Lord” (2/6/12).

After the concert, both Marcus and Sam manned the merchandise table. In between selling CDs and t-shirts, they signed autographs, posed for pictures, and gave hugs. I was one of the first in line to buy new music and get my CDs signed by both. Marcus took my ninja marker, but I figured he needed it more than I did! I got my picture with both and received a couple hugs as well. These guys are so friendly, genuine, and gracious to their fans. Before I walked away, both were adamant about saying, “thank you.” I wish them so much luck for future success.

It’s also particularly important in our physical practice, because it’s easy to “fake it” in certain poses. I find myself doing this more than I would like. I can cheat my leg a little higher in Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana, but if I am honest with myself and drop my hip in line with the other, the limitations of my hamstrings come into play and I have to work a lot harder. Being honest with your body and where you’re at safeguards you from injury. If you’re not strong enough in your core and shoulders to lower in chatturanga, practice with your knees on the floor until you build strength. Use props as tools to guide you deeper in your practice and support you.

“The purposes of the First International Psychedelic Exposition are manifold. On one level we hope to give the general public a glimpse of the psychedelic world and the beautiful creations it has inspired. On another level we hope that open and forthright exposition of psychedelic phenomena by the people it has inspired will facilitate communication between those who are somewhat fearful of the mind expansion experience and those who have had the experience and found a method to present what they found most worthwhile, be it through music, art, visual techniques, or group events.” The catalog also promoted “a common drug available to anyone with $5.00 to spare – lysergic acid diethylamide”.
We arrive home without further incident and it's the strangest sensation. We've twitched and sweated against the restrictions of curfew for two days, yet while we were out for the brief official break, we were jumpy and anxious to get back to the relative safety of our yard. Then, as soon as we're back, we fret, wanting to go out again. Especially as the pressure we're all under, freaked and forced into such close company with one another, means that tensions in the house simmer below the surface at all times, breaking out into frequent arguments that I have to try to mediate.
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now.

One of the only parts I had to totally replace, was the three speed shifter switch and cable. I rounded up an unused piece on eBay for about $9.00. The cable was a few inches longer than what I needed, but it worked just fine. As you can see.. I added a little flair to the bike with some Electra flame grips that I had lying around.

On September 11, 2002 I was walking through Ground Zero in New York City, where the Twin Towers had been attacked just a year ago by terrorists. As I was standing there watching people go through all those feeling and emotions of sadness, I discovered the style of photography that I love and feel passionate about–street photography.

I was just about to tell him that I wasn't here for him when all of a sudden he did a face plant onto the curb. I heard his face hit and then I heard the group of people moan. Then I saw the look of horror on their faces as the poor guy stood up. I could see why the horrified look on their faces as he turned to look at me. His lip was cut and spurting blood, his eye was beginning to swell as if someone was blowing up a balloon and his forehead had so much blood leaking from a gash that it looked like a road map. He just sort of looked at me with this dazed and confused smile, turned and walked away.
Can you remember back to when you had babies to care for and how careful you were with their bedding? You'd make sure the sheets were clean and straight, you'd make the little bed several times a day and as soon as there was a wet sheet, into the washing machine it would go. You did those things, and more, because you knew how important that bed was to your baby. Well, I might be reverting to babyhood because I tend my bed as carefully as I would a cot or crib and I do it because sleep is important. Now let me declare my bias here up front. I LOVE my bed, always have, always will. I am a good sleeper. I'm rarely in bed more than ten minutes before I'm sound asleep. But I also do a lot of my thinking in bed in the cool dark hours of the morning and being in an uncomfortable bed would not be conducive to my sleeping or thinking. If I want to get the most out of every day, I need to sleep well.
In her article, ‘Should the church connect with the Occupy movement?’, St. Francis of Assisi Pastoral Administrator Valerie Chapman, whom at least one local journalist erroneously identifies as “pastor” of the Southwest Portland parish, attempts to convince readers that Catholic Social Teaching tends to support the work(s) of Occupy Wall Street.
I'm pretty happy with what I wrote for HOUND's sequel, though, and it seems to want my attention. I'm trying to fend it off, but being on query for HOUND makes me think about HOUND, which makes me think about what I could do with world and characters next.
Bertie eyed the entrails hungrily. “If you don’t want to, I could finish it off for you?” he offered gallantly, already starting to skulk forward. Reginald narrowed his eyes. Bertie waited. “All the same, Bertie, I need to eat it all,” Reginald sniffed delicately, turning his head away with mild distaste, ”however much it may pain me to consume the revolting morsels,” he added and then looked incredulously at the bare ground where the revolting morsels were no longer in evidence. “Thanks a lot Bertie!” he hissed. “You are such a liability. And a major pain in the scruff.“

I am lucky, I get to look at beautiful objects every day in the museum, but I am envious of the people who got to live and work with these things. I am awestruck with how much detail objects like this elevator façade have. The museum’s own elevators have plain flat facades that neither distinguish or mask them.

The plotting and engineering involved in the first few chapters of the story is a marvel to behold. Davis manages to create four separate mysteries: who is Gene Swendsen, the new chauffeur? What really happened to Kitten in that auto accident? Why is Hilda, her sister, such a nervous wreck? And is the person in the room upstairs really Kitten? Mysterious phone calls to the man who delivered Swendsen to the Corwith home add to the suspense. Each chapter ends with an italicized section that give us insight into "the patient" in the room upstairs. We know the thoughts and feelings of "the patient" and watch as this person turns the pages of a diary written, of course, in the first person but with all references to Kitten in the third person. The diary starts out with glowing entries showing admiration for Kitten then reveal petty envy and finally explode into bitter hatred. But then the diary can't be Kitten's, can it? Why refer to herself in the third person? And if it isn't Kitten's diary, whose is it and how did the patient get a hold of it?

So, today we went and got some birthday pictures made of the girls. I just took the cheap route, with JC Penny. It is always so challenging to get a good picutre of them. I really hope to get my friend to photograph them before we leave, maybe in the Spring. Anyway, we got a couple of good ones. Carolina turned out to be the harder one, because almost all of hers were fake smiles. So, then she wanted sausage and eggs, so we headed to Cracker Barrell. Then we went to Classroom Corner and got a few "learning" things. I got her some lined paper to help in practicing her writing and some dot-to-dot books, she loves! On the way home you could see the sky forever and the clouds were so interesting against a bright blue. I told Lina to look how big God must be to such a huge sky. She said , yes, He must be that big, then she said "those clouds are so rowdy!" I'm not sure where she came up with that one.

10. Yesterday, I was reminded how great a family I’ve got. My older sister was fighting a sinus headache and went to bed early, so my brother-in-law, who doesn’t often feel well, took charge of little A. until bedtime, when my mom took over. Before that, my mom was finishing a project for work, so I was able to clean the kitchen and make a cake she had to have for today. That’s the sort of thing my mom has taught us and it’s really wonderful to be able to help each other. My dad is great to help out, too, as are Sisters #1 and #2, though Sis #2 isn’t home that often. I just love the attitude of servanthood in a house. It makes life so much easier for everyone!

I’m a very weird person. I like taking pictures of everything….literally. I say literally more than the average human being. I suppose by saying literally it will enforce the fact that what I am saying is so literal that you can have zero questions about it. Its weird. I have an odd obsession with pronouncing words correctly. People make fun of me and the way I say “clothes”. I literally (here we go) say kuh-lo-thiz. Thats probably phonetically wrong but it just sounds like it is spelled. I was terrible in English though. I don’t know why I have that habit. I’m severely random. I get excited about new things, hence the reason I started a blog. I make weird faces and noises. All day, errrryday. But that’s me. When I’m really tired I start to get even weirder. Ok, done rambling.

The house, built by George Washington Vanderbilt II (grandson to railroad tycoon Cornelius "Commodore" Vanderbilt) is extremely impressive. Finished in 1895, the 135,000 square foot house contains 250 rooms, including a 70,000 gallon heated indoor swimming pool and a bowling alley. It remains today as the largest privately-owned home in the country.

You can set your own rules and your own standards. I live on my writing income, so if I'd written three wonderful novels and not yet sold them, that would be a failure. If you're a full-time pilot with five children and no partner, writing two pages might be a massive success. Be realistic.

He came from impeccable matrilineal succession of the Royal house. He was connected to Bridei son of Beli (c.672-93) who had fought ‘for the inheritance of his (maternal) grandfather’ at Dunnichen when Nechtan was an impressionable child at court. So the cataclysmic turnaround of affairs which resulted, of great Northumbria having to hand back part of conquered Pictland to the Picts, must have made a deep impression on him.
The children are in school for five and a half hours a day. If they sleep ten hours, they still have seven and a half hours to play and socialize.

About the director:
In April 2006, Leeds university authorities subjected Dr Frank Ellis to an Inquisition after he had an interview published in “Leeds Student". Dr Ellis was sought out for the interview with political bias in mind because of his “peculiar and extreme views". He and his interviewer ranged over many topics but what ignited prejudice against him were his remarks that the average black has a lower IQ than the average white or Asian; that he believed we need to introduce a policy of humane repatriation. There were the usual demonstrations by Unite Against Fascism. The University's decision was purely to persecute a man for holding the wrong opinion: he treated his students fairly and impartially as the interviewer acknowledged Dr Ellis’s “excellent rapport with his students and colleagues". Further, Leeds have a system to prevent unfair marking as the candidate's paper is anonymous and each is marked by 3 different tutors. He was investigated by the West Yorkshire police for incitement to racial hatred. So what is the problem? Dr Ellis was not disciplined for his conduct towards his students, which was exemplary, but persecuted for not expressing the right thoughts on race. In an interview on Talk Sport Ian Collins screamed at Ellis, ”You're mad!” (7)

I really need to start planning more seriously before buying. And then follow through on those plans. Before Christmas I had a vague, half formed idea in my head that it would be really good to make dried apricots in brandy as a gift for my lovely mother. Sadly, time ran away with me and they never did get made. I did accomplish the first step of the plan to make them though... I bought the dried apricots. Really quite a lot of apricots as it happens, because the Kilner jar I was planning on using can take quite a lot of fruit and I thought having a few spare wouldn't be a problem.

Right here we have a cross-pollination of a zombie flick, jungle action, Rambo shoot-em-up, voodoo horror and Friday the 13th gore job. This is like a discount closeout at the Everything Must Go Cliche Store with macho mercenaries, damsels in distress, harrowing escapes, creatures leaping out of the shadows, shocking bloody effects and an ending that is as nihilistic as it is stupid. It's like the film-makers had to do something with all of these leftovers from every other movie made in 1989 so they lumped them all in here, slapped a title on it and hoped for the best.

Unable to stand by as Madison’s future is ripped from her, The Duke, who has inexplicably fallen for the lady he soiled and deserted, makes plans to forge a new future for Madison, a future where he is her husband…whether she likes it or not.

What is the reaction of man when Jesus Christ reveals Himself? We want to look at this in three ways and one of these will relate to you. Naturally we look at Saul of Tarsus. He had been blind spiritually, not comprehending the light. In John 1:5 we see this truth. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.” Up to this point Saul did not recognise his spiritual condition of being in darkness.

There are several varieties of kelp: true kelp, which thrives in cool seas; giant kelp, and bladder kelp, which grow in the North Pacific. Giant kelp is so named because it grows to 213 ft (65 m). Kelp anchors itself to rocky surfaces via tentacle-like roots. From these roots grows a slender stalk with long, leaf-like blades.
Spoon out about 1/3 cup of dough for each shortcake onto the baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches of space between the mounds. Pat each mound down until it is between 3/4 and 1 inch high. (The shortcakes can be made to this point and frozen on the baking sheet, then wrapped airtight and kept in the freezer for up to 2 months. Bake without defrosting – just add at least 5 more minutes to the oven time.)
Apparently this is available on a DVD of Frank Tashlin’s THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT, which is vaguely apt, but it should really be an extra with VERTIGO. Both because of the ways in which Jones’s visuals approach Saul Bass’s (the YouTuber who posted it apparently thinks it’s by Norman McLaren — a fair guess, but WRONG), and in the way the short reverses the sympathies engendered in Hitchcock’s film — a woman trapped and torn and manipulated and molded between two horrible men is replaced by a female manipulator who remodels the men in her life, rejecting the less adaptable model in favour of the one who can literally be bent to her will.

To answer that question, we need to think about the speed of the moral revolution that has pushed this question to the forefront of our culture. In less than a generation, homosexuality has gone from being almost universally condemned to being almost fully normalized in the larger society.
Born on September 15, 1956, Willie Mullins was six-times amateur champion rider in Ireland and his major successes in the saddle included the 1983 John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase at Aintree on Atha Cliath when the also-rans were partnered by the likes of Robert Waley-Cohen and Aintree chairman Lord Daresbury, before taking out a training licence in 1988 and is now the country’s pre-eminent jump handler. As a jockey in the John Smith’s Grand National, his rides included The Ladys Master, who ran out in 1983, and Hazy Dawn, who fell at the sixth the following year. He hails from one of Ireland’s most famous racing families, being a son of the late Paddy Mullins, the outstanding all-round trainer whose most famous star was Dawn Run, winner of the 1984

Too often, people fall into the trap of strife. Someone says something that rubs you the wrong way, and before you know it, there is tension, quarreling and division. The Bible tells us that strife opens the door to “every evil work.” It’s the enemy’s greatest trap to keep people from living in victory. But you don’t have to fall into the trap of strife, you can rise above it. Like today’s verse says, you can simply drop the matter before it turns into something bigger than it needs to be. You don’t have to sink down to somebody’s level and argue with them and try to prove that you’re right. You weren’t put on this earth to correct everybody around you.

One morning I was laying in bed praying about an "Titanic idea" when the prodigal son story popped into my mind. Was it possible that the seed of the idea I had so many years prior fit on the Titanic? I dug back through my old computer files and found the original prologue. Then, in my mind's eye, the story of a younger son, an older son, a woman who cared for them both--and the loving father--played out in my mind.

A few weeks back, I was an enjoying a dinner with some good friends. Over dinner, the conversation turned to ice cream (this is a common occurrence when you hang out with me). Specifically, my friends expressed their delight at being members of the Dairy Queen Blizzard Fan Club. Every couple of months, they receive coupons for free Blizzards. All this time, DQ had been handing out free ice cream I’d been paying full price like a chump! Not long after we parted ways, I too signed up for the DQ Blizzard Club. Over the past few weeks, my husband has signed up, my sisters have signed up, and if it were allowed I’d get my cat to sign up too. I’ve now become accustomed to a weekly Blizzard, with or without coupons. It’s crossed over to that dangerous place when I eat an item of food so much I give it an obnoxious nickname. Observe:
Great cast, good music (seeing it again I note the little "heroic action!" stings and other tricks of the music more) and naturally lots of funny.

As discussed in earlier posts, a lot has to do with the weather, time of day, lighting and the location of the sun relative to the photographer and the dog / handler team. Also, the use of a zoom lens can remove a good portion of the background, which allows the dog and handler to become the most dominant element within the frame. But, zooming in is not always the best choice as many of the exercises require tracking the dog down the field and getting the shot at a critical moment.
Another example of the transition to a racialist America is African-Americans’ success in removing much of the negativity associated with color by changing the connotations of darkness. Black has become beautiful and not just for blacks. Furthermore, the recent preference for being called blacks instead of African-Americans suggests greater comfort in being perceived first and foremost as black Americans.

Let's see... Ty is currently applying for other jobs. He's applying in Alaska as well as here in Bellingham. He applied at a Jewelers amongst other things. Good timing if he gets that, Christmas sales will be up.
We traditionally camp when we're on Salt Spring, but this time my mom and step dad rented a beautiful old heritage home for the week. The kitchen was amazing, with custom built free standing fir cabinets and an AGA. Though I've always wanted an AGA (which is always warm and ready for use), it kind of lost its charm when we were hit with a heat wave, at which point everyone gave the kitchen a wide berth.
Why: I was admiring some art from Draw Something (are you playing? I can't get enough. We literally lie in bed drawing and laughing and cornholing except Buster) when I spotted this:
#739 - Anatomy of a Murder (1959) - (#872 on TSPDT) Jimmy Stewart is one of those actors who never seem like they are acting. He is just smoothly natural with a homespun charm that covers up how sharp-witted and powerful of an actor he truly is. His performance in this Otto Preminger film is one of his finest, but such a great film as this - one of Preminger's finest as well - is already quite spectacular, even without Stewart. But yeah, he certainly makes it better. Many in the field of law have called this the most accurate look at a court trial ever put onto film, but more importantly, much more importantly (who wants truth when they can have the artifice of the most beautiful fraud in the world - yeah, I said it), is that Preminger has sewn together a succulent and quite devious motion picture experience, and one of the main contributing factors (along with Some Like it Hot and Psycho) to the eventual downfall of the Hays Code in Hollywood.
Well, the drought is definitely over. We've been getting our normal rainy afternoons almost every day for the last week or so (I think) I'm starting to remember now that we live in a sort of bog here in NF. It was starting to feel more like a dessert for a while there. (Or is it desert? I get those confused. One is a hot place with sand and one is a sweet treat... My spelling sucks.) And you know, at 48 years old, I should be embarrassed by that, but I just don't really care. Ten years ago I would have been, but now not so much. I just accept it as one of my quirks. Yea, that's it, I'm quirky!
Heh...none really..except for Del McCoury (Friday 1:50 - 2:30 Austin Ventures Stage) ...go see them and clap your hands. Does anyone else think there should be a few more? Of course my rule with Bluegrass is 3 songs is just enough.
Second, we are training Afghan Security Forces to get the job done. Those forces have surged, and will peak at 352,000 this year. The Afghans will sustain that level for three years, and then reduce the size of their military. And in Chicago, we will endorse a proposal to support a strong and sustainable long-term Afghan force.
After my own scripture and prayers, and a bit of time in the bathroom to get ready, I will then start getting breakfast ready. I am trying to be better about making breakfast for Steve before he leaves. Many of my breakfasts I will prep the night before so it's easier in the morning.

The FCC knew about the issues it now wants to study in this newest NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making) before the spectrum was auctioned in 2008. Further, the interference issues were taken into account by the FCC at that time, and informed the rules under which the spectrum was auctioned and purchased.
I do think beer blogs have a valid, and dare I say important, place in beer though. Beer rating blogs are a dime a dozen. Nation wide beer blogs...also a dime a dozen. But the local beer blog I think is a vital and helpful resource, not to pat myself on the back. Also, (Warning: I am going to pat myself on the back again) blogs or sites like My Last Pint and Pints and Panels are fun (I guess not so important, but still) because of their uniqueness and creativity.
Now, THIS is what I'm talking about. No werewolves. No vampires. No British isles fairytale constructs. No Arthurian legends, creaky with age, being unfolded and poorly cleansed of the dust of ages for the nth, nth, nth time. No. This is neither the U.S. nor the UK, but Trenčín, Slovenia, baby.

Mom was pessimistic and tried to dissuade me. But already a budding foodie and curious about most things culinary, my argument was simple. We liked fruit. We like cake. We liked my grandmother’s blueberry cake which combined fruit and cake. It only made sense that we would like this fruitcake from Texas.

The SF Arts Commission reeled from stupid decision to scandal as news broke that they had chosen former dog murderer Tom Otterness for a huge project to make sculptures for the Central Subway - which is another scandal but not an artistic one. Eventually, the commission "fired" him but because of legal issues, still had to let him keep a substantial portion of the grant money. Lots of SF artists were asking why the "SF" Arts Commission couldn't chose a local artist! http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/31/DD941MG3BJ.DTL
All that walking is as rejuvenating as the sleep and relaxation. It's also a key to eating pastry without guilt or weight gain. We typically cover 8-12 miles a day in Paris, but with all that walking we're paradoxically less hungry. My theory is that the food we are eating is so delicious that we need less of it to feel satisfied. We've never dined at any restaurant with a star, Michelin or otherwise, while in Paris. We prefer to find neighborhood bistros, or stock up on cheeses, fruit, bread and chocolate at the little epicerie around the corner from our hotel. The epicerie is pricier than a grocery store, but they have a fabulous selection of cheeses, and they make amazing puff pastry tomato tarts with pesto. Or we pick up a couple of pastries from a patisserie (always checking Paris Pâtisseries first). We open our window and stare down at the rooftops of the city we love while enjoying our room picnic.

The Full Moon of April is usually called the Egg Moon. In Algonquian it is called Pink Moon. Other names are Sprouting Grass Moon, Fish Moon, Seed Moon, and Waking Moon. In Hindi it is known as Hanuman Jayanti. The Full Moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise, the only night in the month when the Moon is in the sky all night long. The rest of the month, the Moon spends at least some time in the daytime sky.
Despite being selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the late rounds of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, he never was invited by the Flyers to participate in a training camp and came to North America as a free agent in 1997. He started in the lower reaches of the minors, first with the Baton Rouge Kingfish of the ECHL. He then joined the Manitoba Moose of the IHL for 14 games, going 8-4-1-1.
Is how the wizard "Amazing" Kreskin described their foes in the graveyard of Barrow Island. In last night's Weird Adventures game (in Lorefinder), Boris, Kreskin, and Don Diabolico were ambushed by ghoul hooligans out for dangerous kicks. The punks got danger in a lethal dose: The fact that that were teenagers didn't spare them from the guns of our hardboiled adventurers. Only one of the three attackers escaped with his life.

PT: For many entrepreneurs, starting their company may be their first experience in a business management role – how can strong leadership skills better assist them in their new endeavor?
With Hanna’s retreat from the spotlight and the failed media blackout controversy, the second half of Girls to the Front feels much different from the first. The LA Times Evelyn McDonnell put it simply: “If the first part of Marcus’ book is exhilarating, the end can be depressing. Instead of supporting ‘girl love,’ as they’d earlier vowed, members turned against one another and their male sympathizers.” Corin Tucker and others took Fugazi to task for its song “Suggestion” which describes sexual harassment from a female perspective. As Marcus points out, few other male bands of Fugazi’s reputation even broached the subject let alone accused its audience of complicity, yet to some in the RG it sounded “like a self righteous white boy appropriating girls’ issues so he could appear more virtuous.” (116) Hanna dismissed similar efforts by other bands: “A lot of this white straight edge boy thing singing about sexism is so incredibly stupid to me, I just can’t even deal with it.” (229)

The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that the Security Council should adopt what will be issued by the UN observers not by the group of the so-called Friends of Syria, adding” they say they will evaluate how the Syrian leadership is implementing Annan’s plan, which is unacceptable.”

Jeff Andrews – I have been (and continue to be) influenced by so many things. Amazing master designers like Billy Haines, David Hicks and Andre Putman have definitely inspired me. More contemporary designers like Barbara Barry, Kerry Joyce and Roy McMakin have continued to influence me on different levels. I would have to say that I am most influenced by people of talent and taste that have lived a life of style that we most of us can only dream of and learn from…Yves Saint Laurent, Rudolph Nureyev and Coco Chanel to name a few. It is all about pulling bits that inspire you most and making them your own in design that make it a personally rewarding experience.
So why are the people voicing dissatisfaction with the ending of a product they loved, in this medium, suddenly whiners/cretins/bros/entitled? I think it’s a statement of optimism on the complainer’s part really. They know that video games offer the chance to be continually upgraded/changed (through DLCs and mods). Knowing that, why wouldn’t they suggest they want an ending they like? It’s like telling someone at a restaurant that they can’t add or subtract anything to the dish they order, because “that’s going against the chef’s vision.” My request for capers or no mayonnaise doesn’t make me entitled. It means I’m using the service as it is expected in the given situation. The folks at Bioware pretty much promise that there’s going to be DLC available (and there was already some on launch day), so it isn’t even like these gamer/restaurant-goers are going to a really expensive, high-end dinner (where it is Not Done to request substitutions. At those restaurants you really are going and paying for the chef’s vision). They’re going to a Red Lobster and are upset when the server, chef, and other patrons call them babies for not wanting the french fries, but would prefer broccoli instead.
There are 2 shades to this, #1 Light Beige and #2 Natural Beige (which I bought). I’m thinking the recommended retail price of this is 60,000Won, which is around US$56. However, the duo cost me only US$72, so each was just USD$36!! Pretty amazing deal if you ask me =)

The reality is, I am not using one Google extension or FireFox add-on. Not a single one. At least, if it did not come pre-installed, I am not using it. I used to use the add-blocker that was famed on FireFox, but to be honest, I have left that browser, and even am using IE a lot less in favor of Chrome. I might not like Google as a company much, but Chrome is a pretty solid, fast and ‘visually’ light browser.

Some 1,000 protesters marched in Tel Aviv on Saturday night in a show of opposition to the possibility of an Israeli strike in Iran. Over 2,300 citizens confirmed their attendance on Facebook. The march, titled "Israelis against a war with Iran," began at Habima Square and was expected to conclude with a rally at Meir Park.
Overall the walking/jogging wasn’t all that bad, maybe I am in not nearly as bad of shape as I was thinking before. My legs didn’t really feel like jello till the very last jog. One the cool down walk, that is when I started to feel my knees starting to hurt.

External additions can be problematic if your bigger and better house is out of character with the surrounding neighborhood in size and style. It can be even worse if your do-it-yourself project lacks professional polish. Even more modest improvements — such as doors, windows or awnings — can hurt if they don’t match your home’s architectural style.

Casey’s Contraptions:
Moderate consumption of alcohol (1-2 drinks daily) increases the levels of HDL cholesterol in blood. However, it does not lower the amount of LDL cholesterol. Although drinking alcohol in moderation is considered to prevent heart diseases, no consensus has been reached by the medical fraternity regarding this belief. In fact drinking too much alcohol raises triglyceride levels and increases blood pressure.

Now we have animal poems on our agenda for this morning.
Coming down from the mountain to a new life in the city seems a thrill beyond imagining. When Miri and her friends from Mount Eskel set off to help the future princess Britta prepare for her royal wedding, she is happy about her chance to attend school in the capital city. There, Miri befriends students who seem so sophisticated and exciting . . . until she learns that they have some frightening plans. They think that Miri will help them, that she should help them. Soon Miri finds herself torn between loyalty to the princess and her new friends’ ideas, between an old love and a new crush, and between her small mountain home and the bustling city.

I paused. Because life had taught me a lot of things by this point and one of them was – not everyone wants to know the truth all the time. They want to tell you SOME things, so you’ll know they have a life. Maybe they want you to think it’s cool or eccentric, maybe they’re looking for comfort. What they don’t want you to do, is tell them how you really feel, which in this case was APPALLED.

Minorities: Broadly refers to anyone who isn’t a white American. According to the Book of Mormon, God invites “all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God” (2 Ne. 26:33). Because all are alike, church members are counseled to “marry those who are of the same racial background” (Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3).

You see, Harold convinced his followers, something “did” happen on May 21. It just didn’t happen where anyone could see it. It was a “spiritual” event. God judged the world on that day, and closed the door to salvation. (Like when God closed the door on Noah’s Ark once Noah and family were inside.) Only those who were inside the Ship on that day will be saved when the Ultimate End comes on October 21 and the whole world is destroyed. The job of Family Radio now is only to “feed the sheep” inside the Ark. Only five more months to sail, and then all the waiting will be over. Really. Guaranteed.

I cannot comprehend the turmoil, upset and distress Michael, his wife, family and friends have experienced over the past few days. My thoughts and my support are with him, and I would hope all those who have followed his blog and the advice and warnings he writes on an almost daily basis provide the same thoughts and support. In doing so, he has found himself the victim of a despicable attack on a platform of the Internet so many authors now use to have their voices heard and their books bought and read.

There is, therefore, special need of public liberality on their behalf . . . . Contributions may he addressed to George T. Strong, Treasurer. No. 68 Wall St., New York.”

Perhaps, it would be a good move for Labour to adopt a more mature attitude of a similar spirit, sort out which message it wants to get out and act in a more constructive manner and work with the government to find a solution. At the moment the Labour party appears opportunistic, not only on policy relating to income, tax evasion and charity giving but on a range of issues. Labour needs to start showing itself as a credible alternative as a government rather than an anti-coalition party. Or maybe that’s their election strategy and they’ll just fill in Miliband’s blank sheet of paper if and when he gets into Number 10…

I competed my first trade with Craig2 over on the SCF hockey boards. He posted a bunch of cards he was looking to move, and one caught my eye. I requested a price and a scan, and though he couldn't provide a scan at that time, he informed me the card featured a patch piece nicer than similar ones found on eBay. He said he'd send it my way and I could just send him $5 or so later on.
But the thoughts are trickling back, and I know that the more I write, the more they'll start flooding back, and so relief is in sight there, too.

It was definitely time to try a new enchilada sauce. This sauce goes with an enchilada recipe I'll be posting shortly. I decided to throw out the chile powders for this one and use actual dried chiles. Chipotles are a spicy, smoky dried chile that work in a lot of dishes. This one worked well with the addition of a little cinnamon and some oregano.

Sending everyone lots of love out there in honor of Valentine's Day. Have any big plans? My man and I will be having a mellow evening in tonight... although we already sort of celebrated on Sunday by going to a Swell Season concert at a teeny venue (this was our 8th time seeing them live. I'll admit it. We're groupies and proud). As always when seeing Glen & Marketa perform, it was magic.
In addition to the distillery itself there is a comfortable tasting room (including some seating outside), a gift shop, and a small museum. Lebanon has only recently shown up on my radar. It's a lovely little town with a nice historic core. The big attraction for bourbon fans is Kentucky Cooperage, the Kentucky branch of Independent Stave, which makes most of the barrels for the bourbon industry. Lebanon is the seat of Marion County, which as the name suggests was founded by and still has a large Catholic population.

The secular reviewers of the Twilight series call it, “A dark romance that seeps into the soul.” The original title of Twilight was “Corpse,” but the publisher changed it to make it more appealing. The content of Twilight is in opposition to many Scriptures: it promotes sorcery, divination and witchcraft . Yet some church youth groups and “Christian” movie review sites suggest the relationship and sexual tension of two teenagers, one being a demonic vampire, draw parallels with Christian morals with lessons for the Christian to be found within the stories!

Matthew 6:33 But (A)seek first (B)the kingdom of God and his righteousness, (C)and all these things will be added to you. God instructs us to seek after Him alone and let tomorrow worry for itself as this goes against our very will. In hindsight, Jesus could be calling us to faith, trust,hope and love in him as it would take faith to cast away our worries for ourselves, endure the backlash from the world for doing what Christ says and to follow a God that the world hates.
The Tower already exists.
The den. This is mostly my husband's space that we designed and decorated when he was bishop, so that he could have people over to talk. But I like that it has that kind of history. It has become, since that time, the refuge. When the kids come in they are a little more careful to keep it clean and to even speak a little lower. We write in here. We sing and record in here. We read and gather our thoughts.

That didn’t mean I was done, though! I had a coffee, and with the coffee came some wonderful macarons, petit fours and chocolates:
Simone’s favorite movies at the moment are Meet the Fockers (it’s a long story) and The Muppet Movie (although when the frog bounty hunter shows up near the end, she gets scared and asks me to switch it off). Her favorite book is King Bidgood’s in the Bathtub. We’ve both been digging the Danger Mouse faux spaghetti western soundtrack Rome. It’s killer: the best soundtrack to a nonexistent movie, ever. It’s one of the only albums she doesn’t switch off after a few minutes.
I used Staz-on Midnight Blue ink. I still thought I might draw patterns at this point, and I don't like to mix blacks, so I went with the dark blue. Staz-on is waterproof, and I knew I'd be adding more water.

“I heard that, Mel.” Betty said in pretended annoyance as she came back in the room. “There he goes again,” she continued, talking to me now, “He always likes to pretend like he’s all high and mighty, but inside all that toughness, he’s just a big baby.”
Check back the week of Feb 1 for more details!
I wanted gold-colored handles to tie in with the cabinet handles and the general color scheme of the room. I was debating between drop pulls and ring pulls and decided to go with ring pulls in the end, although I think either would have looked nice. I found some nice round brass ring pulls from Lee Valley.
I was pleased with my results and then I started my hunt for paper. Ordinarily I pick out my papers first and then color. I'm really not sure why I didn't do that this time but I really couldn't find any papers in my stash that were worthy of such a beautiful image. (Actually, I couldn't find any that matched!) That meant having to go to Enchanted Cottage on my lunch break to see what I could find. Well, I found three papers that I thought would make a lovely combination so I bought them and as soon as I got home from work, I hit my stamp room determined to make another "Fran-tage" beauty. The more I looked at the pink patterned paper from Creative Imaginations, the more I wanted to use the touching "Hope" message printed there. I'm a cancer survivor so this is something near and dear to my heart. I cut out my image and started playing around with the paper but I just couldn't get it configured in a manner I felt was right for "Fran-tage." I had cut my base to be a 6" square from Bazzill. I cut my bottom layer of patterned paper from Creative Imaginations in a 5 3/4" square. I cut two strips of the green Karen Foster patterned paper about an inch wide and I then edged each strip with a Martha Stewart punch. From my Creative Imaginations "Hope" paper I cut my middle panel to fit the word across the bottom section. I adhered the punched strips to each side of the top layer and centered both top and bottom layers on my base. In order to add some texture to my image, I added some of the new fresh green and lavender crushed glass glitters from Stampendous! I used glossy accents to hold my glitter on and as soon as it was dry enough, I pop-dotted my image onto the card. I added a little sheer pink ribbon with a pearl as an accent. I chose the pearl because even with something as small as a grain of sand irritating the oyster, something as beautiful as a pearl can grow. There are many things in life that irritate us but we can still radiate beauty from within if we choose to. I would like to think that because of my cancer, I'm now able to see more of the beauty in life around me. I still tend to rush through my days sometimes but I'm far more aware of my surroundings and of how blessed I am with God's grace to still be here. So, without further ado, here's my card. I hope (no pun intended) that you like it.
We will compete in the pair on Thur then fours for the rest of our time there. The focus has always been the same. Go as fast as you can in each boat and give the best showing for the work that has been done. We are still pre Christmas so I am not expecting any early presents but I am anticipating that we should be able to produce a number of good solid performances. I am not playing things down here rather being realistic about what needs to be done and how we set ourselves to continue and progress moving forward.
I walk through the rooms and halls and remember. Or try to remember. The kidadults are upset. This is their childhood home. This is our past. Our history. Their height markers are still on the doorjambs of their bedroom closet doors. How tall they have become. How small they once were.

I, like most Americans who’ve taken time to listen to the choruses of unending diatribe coming from these people, notice that it’s remarkably the same screed coming from group to group, wherever these people congregate… if it can be called a message. It’s actually more of a melange of regurgitated Marxist claptrap. Right from the mouths of leftist agitators, college and university professors, even high school and grade school teachers. This is what our billions and billions of education dollars purchased.

Spring is a beautiful time of the year in Brisbane with Jacarandas blooming throughout the city. It’s a very colourful display that leave beautiful lavender sprinkles on the ground. This is without a doubt my favourite tree.
However a further point to be clarified is that the mere appearance of contradiction between two statements (either Qur’an or Sunnah) is not sufficient to claim abrogation. There must be a divine evidence to state that the abrogation is actually relating to the abrogated. There must be a clear context concerning the occurrence of the abrogation. There are a number of incidents where two, apparently contradicting revelations where implemented in total compatibility. Concerning the above verses from At-Taubah they should be understood without abrogation.
They cite example of farmers, like Papamma, who have already started a second green revolution. Her house is full of vegetation. Not an inch of waste land around Papamma�s house or farm can be spotted. �Do you see the black sprinkles on the leaves and the beans? That is cow dung water I sprinkled to avoid pests,� says the 60-year-old Papamma who lives in D. Kurubarahalli, a remote village in Kolar, nearly 90 KM from Bangalore.
Otherwise – do rush out and buy the newie from The Caretaker as it is fantastic; do play Ramesses very loud; and don’t forget if you are ever feeling down you can always turn to The Monkees for support.
‘For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!’ Galatians 2.19-21 NIV.
So they dug all day
Well, and I admitted to have left matches in one of the bags and they wanted me to take them out. Since they might explode, I guess. They also asked me to remove the disconnected battery, which I did assuming I would have to get a replacement in the USA (annoying, but it wasn’t like I could ride away), but instead it was taped inside a box and strapped to the seat, with bungie cords. Not really sure what that was supposed to accomplish, other than making it more likely to spill.
And then came The Dark Ages. We shall not speak of them in depth. Suffice it to say that during this period of about eighteen months, many not-nice things happened in my life. My house was flooded. My editor turned down my third book. Family members became ill. *I* became ill. And while I kept writing through this, it was to very little effect. I didn't finish anything, and every time that I nearly did, my agent or my publisher didn't like it.
For Theo he says,”As we already know, Theo Walcott will also miss the Carling Cup Final after being stretchered off in the same game. Again, the problem may be relatively short term. I saw him this morning, he has a classic ankle sprain. We don’t think there is any more damage to it. But it is still a sprain. We are sad for him too. He is out for Sunday and maybe one or two more weeks.”

Lets look at this time last year: Alicia packed up Peter and forcibly moved him to a new apartment, then got in a hotel elevator with Will on the way to open the doors on their long-thwarted passion. Now that’s the kind of cliffhanger that has you marking the days until the show returns in the fall.

This is all about what I choose to make – as I said prophetically in my first post, “I’m not so well known and in demand, that I can just make what I like and sell it – I will have to have an eye on what my public will like, and what they would be prepared to pay”

This blog post doesn’t intend to give solutions to these problems but only a roundup of what we obviously have right now. I don’t blame those who go outside the country to work, it’s a solution and they made that decision. I’m just a bit concerned if they are not treated well or have been captives of war.

The explosions happened hours after Obama left Afghanistan after a quick visit to mark the first anniversary of Usama bin Laden’s death. He spoke to troops and signed a pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to govern the U.S. presence in Afghanistan through 2024.
Bake the quiche in a preheated 350 degree oven until it is golden brown on top and the center is no longer liquid. This will take anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour depending on your oven. Just start checking it at 45 minutes. You'll notice as it cooks that it begins to puff up a bit. It will deflate once it comes out of the oven but the "puff" is a good way to tell which areas are cooked and which are still liquid.
Rather than a laundry list of legislation that Americans want repealed, suffice it to say that his major legislative initiatives are widely regarded as weakening the economy while growing the government. In this he has been abetted by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, along with brain-dead Democrats in Congress who clearly did not bother to read the bills before voting on them.

Two family members recently asked me if I was still alive. They follow this blog to stay updated on my life and apparently the fact that I haven't updated this in a month leads to concern in the family about my well being. So this is just a quick update to say that yes, I'm still alive. Yes, everything is fine. No, I haven't died or fallen off the face of the earth. I've just been really busy.

In 1992, Lenny produced an album for the French singer Vanessa Paradis on which he played most of the instruments and wrote several lyrics. In 1993, Kravitz wrote "Line Up" for Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. Together with Mick Jagger, he recorded a new version of "Use Me" for Jagger's album 'Wandering Spirit'. Lenny also worked with Al Green and Curtis Mayfield.
The first voice came from the man on the left. “That is right. Kneel before us. Worship us, for we are greater than your God.” His voice rang out with good-natured jocularity. Peter felt sure that his face was covered to hide a visage totally out of place in this den of evil men.
I recently saw an article on umpteen ways to avoid overwhelm. Just looking at that article made me feel overwhelmed! So, let’s do them one at a time. You can start to move forward today, and feel like you are doing SOMETHING to improve how you feel and where you are. If on the other hand, you are currently doing this practice, you can check it off your mental box, and feel GREAT.
In fact, I'm usually just the opposite. I'm high. I'm exhausted and spent. My body is damp and smells bad. But I'm feeling good. Really, really good. Because I'm strong. My muscles have worked hard and done their job. My body has done what it was created to do, and done it in a very efficient way. I'm happy and grateful to be healthy. I'm thrilled to be smelly and tired.
The Uncle Eric books and study guides (written by Richard Maybury) look like an interesting way to begin formal economics. Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? covers basic economics. Money Mystery is the next step in the series, covering career, business and investments. Clipper Chip Strategy covers the economics of business specifically. Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career & Financial Security covers the basic belief systems, or models, we base our decisions on; these decisions underly economics (we may begin with this book as it is the foundation for the series). Each book also has a study guide that goes along with it.
Anyhoo, one or two of you asked about my issue with ribbons and bows (yesterday's post), well I can't do them. It makes no difference how hard I try, how carefully I place the ribbon and/or bow, they simply do not look as if they are part of the card - they just look plonked on as an afterthought. I guess I'm simply not a girl for excess frippery.
We’re wrapping on the series and so far Hae Ra has only been using passive-aggressive tactics against Mi Roo. While the other characters are really reflecting on their own needs and motives, Hae Ra’s been largely ignorant of it. I think Mi Roo’s been very good about trying to keep her distance from Jin Oh. Is it her fault that he remembered her birthday? I know that Hae Ra loves Jin Oh but is forcing him to love her really going to make her happy in the end?

Then there were the white balance and exposure controls. You're limited by the gamut of the film itself and whatever colors it can give you. While you can choose your film for its color profile and even use filters to alter the color at any given time, you're still limited by the color gamut available in the chemicals of the film itself. With RAW, your gamut and exposure range is at least 10 times or greater than that of film- there's just no comparison the brightness and saturation that you can achieve in digital compared to film. Strike 5 against film.
Be the Gods and Goddesses, the Kings and Queens you all are. Know that you are special, but no more so than any other. Use your power wisely and rule yourself with a feather, not a whip. Be wise, be compassionate, be understanding when another asks you a question that may seem mundane or trivial to you. Kindness that was shown to you, show to others. Judge not lest you are prepared to judge yourself for it later. Reach out to all of us when you feel the need to, but know that the best guidance you need or seek, is to be found within or close at hand through the Spirit Guides you chose for yourself. I can, we can, answer your questions but we ask you to remember, we speak in God Code as well. Till next time I would like to thank David for taking the time out of his busy schedule with God to share this with you.
Oh, by the way, ASA's decision to ban it is in fact even more ridiculous than for the reasons outlined above.

Rivars says he’ll soon get positive evidence about what Par-Chavorlem is up to. He’ll get it to Gary who will turn it over to Symvoret. Par-Chavorlem appoints Gary as interpreter for Symvoret with instructions to translate in such a way that it’s favorable to the administration. Symvoret offers him a huge land grant on another planet for Gary to interpret correctly. The fourth element are Gary’s fellow interpreters. They think he’s a spy for the administration. Two of them want Gary’s girfriend Elizabeth to kill Par-Chavolem or else they’ll kill Gary.

We raced around catching up with long lost friends and going to an engagement party. I took the baby quilt I made last week to give to the parents-to-be and they loved it. I think I may have gained a few orders too.

Finally was the Supplication. As I said in the Russian River Rumble, this is my favorite of the available sours and it didn't change after having all five of these. It has an inviting sour cherry nose and the flavors are a nice balance of fruit and sour. Unlike the currants in Consecration, the cherries have a noticeable and delicious presence that I really enjoy. Jo liked this one the most as well and is now asking how much cases cost so that's a huge endorsement.
But just in the last week I’ve come across some great examples that have really stayed with me.

Inside the strategically placed jar of evil (added for dramatic effect), are gourmet gummi bears that are regularly supplied by our Top Administrator through the ordering of 5 lb bags on a regular basis. It’s apparently a vice for her, and as vices go… you start out getting them for free, but eventually everyone pays, one way or another! As I notice the fluctuating level of gummi bears in this jar throughout the day… apparently those gummi bears are the “crack” of the candy world!

Even with this 'studio' dining room set-up, I'm still cramped in terms of space. My HUGE, most-frustrating challenge!! Since my light is limited in it's reach, I'm really limited in the span of the shots I can take. Which is why most of my photos are close-ups. I don't have the opportunity to take shots with wide spans, gorgeous back-drops and backgrounds, or fully-set tables and place settings.
Now I didn’t want the top piece to stay exposed and I didn’t want fabric on the top, because I was afraid it would get dirty and since I would be stapling it on I wouldn’t be able to remove it and wash it.
First, let me say that when you are running along side a bike and a Rip Stick, you just naturally run a little faster. So I was feeling pretty good about this little family exercise outing. And then my son challenged me to a race going uphill on his Rip Stick.

Scorching sand burned at her feet and bitterness ate at her heart. Mellie pumped her legs as fast as they would go. Her feet pounded with the rhythm of her emotions, beating a tempo with the crashing waves. Run-a-way. Run-a-way. Run-a-way. Adrenaline pulsed through her veins, quickening her step.

Teach us your ways and lead us down the plain, uncomplicated path of truth for your name’s sake.
The game show has been a lost art form in Australia having been replaced with oversized scratchies (Deal Or No Deal) or hyperactive nonsense (Millionaire Hotseat) which makes Letters & Numbers appearance all the more enjoyable. While Channel 7 were forcing contestants to catch ping pong balls in a box strapped to their butt SBS were getting back to basics with a local version of the UK’s Countdown. Letters & Numbers isn’t flashy, but it doesn’t have to be; it’s still the best game show on TV.

*The messages. While a jumbles mess, the messages were still good ones to take on and I am glad someone is trying to get them out there. Drunk driving (and underage drinking in general!), gay rights, learning not to be so shallow and judgmental of people. All very good things to get out to teens.
I shrugged a little. "Others might not agree with me, but I think all promises are equal. What I mean is that some promises might be bigger than others, but they're all important, and once someone makes a promise, it's important to keep those promises as much as possible. Sometimes things will happen that might keep someone from keeping a promise, but that person still needs to make an effort. That's part of integrity."

Most remarkable of all is that Northern Scotland (57ºN latitude) was almost the last to be hit. Throughout November, temperatures remained a balmy 50ºF. Even (spring-flowering) gorse burst into bloom. It recalled an equally abnormal episode in April this year, where temperatures in the same corner of Scotland hit all-time highs.
I met my friend Nester for coffee the other day. We always say we are going to meet for coffee, but actually its just to grab a cup, talk as fast as we can about 9,000 different things before we run out, jump in one of our cars, and then hit the thrifts stores. I love going thrifting with Nester. We walk in together, split apart, meet back up, show each other what we found, try on clothes, and then I always model something for her to get her honest opinion, which she will always give. We talk, share, dream, usually repeating things over and over because we are easily distracted by all the junk just screaming to be taken home! When I leave our thrifting adventures I always feel so happy, almost giddy. I guess its spending time with a dear friend doing something that I love. Thrifting is my therapy. Digging though all that junk, the hunt, the projects that come to mind, the dreaming up ideas from different cast off pieces, it just fills me up. But also to thrift with someone you love spending time with who also appreciates the hunt, well that is just about the best thing.
It’s unsurprising that Gleave is thinking in terms of the long-game, considering it’s taken him eight years to come up, unencumbered by hype, on pop’s inside track. In 2006, the first incarnation of Example emerged – as a semi-novelty, sample-reliant rapper from the mean streets of Fulham (less street, more cul-de-sac) who was the last act signed to Mike Skinner’s ill-fated vanity label, The Beats.

I have something that I need to say to you, however, I'm not so sure I'm ready to say it yet. I need some time to digest the truth of what it is and figure out how I'm going to say it so that it doesn't sound too crazy. It may take a while for me to do this. I'm working on it. My therapist is helping me, but I haven't gotten there yet. I will. Hopefully I will do so soon.

None of this should be surprising. In a global marketplace, there is a strong incentive to cut the cost of labor, either by outsourcing production or by insourcing workers. This two-way process will continue until wage rates are more or less the same throughout the world. So it doesn’t matter how low the wages are in labor-importing countries. What matters is whether the wages are even lower in labor-exporting countries. Such is the logic of globalization.
Especially when the peach ice cream is nestled inside a lovely waffle cone. This has been one of my favorite sweet treats lately. I think the peachness of it makes me think it's summer time. Somehow, I never get to finish the entire portion of ice creamy goodness all by myself. I have a little boy whose eyes light up when he sees me walking into the room with it and suddenly any toy he was playing with is forgotten.
Day 2 we relaxed at home on a rainy day and let the girls watch movies and make cupcakes. We also did a bike riding tour of the Stanford Campus (put on by Jen). The campus is magnificent. I loved all the architecture and green foliage.

The other day, after the Florida primary, I heard possibly the greatest political metaphor I've ever heard, in reference to Newt Gingrich's reasoning behind staying the Republican primary race.
15. The brain operates on the same amount of power as 10-watt light bulb. The cartoon image of a light bulb over your head when a great thought occurs isn’t too far off the mark. Your brain generates as much energy as a small light bulb even when you’re sleeping.

Sec. 1021, the bill’s discretionary detention provision, authorizes the President to detain persons who “substantially supported” forces “associated” with al-Qaeda or the Taliban that “are engaged in hostilities” against the U.S. or its “coalition partners.” None of the quoted terms are defined. We do not know what constitutes substantial support, hostilities, or our coalition partners. Critically, the bill does not attempt to define “associated forces,” either. Without knowing what qualifies as an associated force, no one can be sure they are safe from the government’s detention.
My immediate reactions was likely similar to those of everyone else--run a quick inventory of the family. Where were they and did they know? I called my recently widowed mother who was angry and frightened. As soon as I felt she was calm I began calling the kids, and the the unthinkable happened. The Pentagon!

This morning the horizon is dark grey in the north - whether from fire or rain we cannot yet tell. There is a touch of moisture on the wind although I cannot smell that magical rain smell. But then I am not an elephant. We pass one heading directly towards the dark sky, the rhythm of his steady pace belying his traveling speed. A flock of open bill storks pass overhead in classic V formation heading the same way. Their wings flicker white against the dark clouds.

There is a spin that Gordon Brown like other people will say things that they don't really mean. So, Labour spinners are actively saying that the Prime Minister is disingenuous as a defence to a worse perception. It is truly so very disappointing that this is the man who already leads us, and that Labour supporters are paying their subs for an army of spin masters who must go on television to make excuses for Brown. If the Prime Minister was lacking in frankness and sincerity in that interview, and his cheer-leaders are shouting this fact from the rooftops; then why should we ever believe a single word he ever has to say?

But last Thursday at the required public meeting with the Beachside Properties Inc, citizens held in their hands copies of the environmental reports and Ministry responses that were originally denied them – all thanks to the folks at the Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary who somehow managed to obtain copies of the reports and put them on the internet at their Chancery Lane – Long Beach resource page.

I have some of your clothes. Mom gave me your pajamas to wear when I spent the night, and the beige ones just aren't my style. I don't think they were yours, either. Bears on a man who made each different tartan his own? Exactly. I can't bring myself to do anything with them, toss them or give them to an unknown who might not appreciate who you were. I was across the country when you died, and part of me worries that I'll be discarding what you wore when you told K you were glad she'd made the trip safely, when you last fell asleep with Mom making sure you'd taken those pills. You'd think this was no big deal, put them in a bag already, but I can't do it, and I can't bring myself to ask her which pair they were. It wouldn't be fair. Some of these clothes are still in a bag in my hallway. I caught Cricket laying on them, right there in the upright suitcase, and I love that she did, because you would have gotten a kick out of it. I would have called you to tell you, 30 seconds of nothing of consequence punctuated by a giggle, and we would have said our goodbyes. Until the next silly thing happened. I think about calling you like this a lot, particularly with each and every dumb pun I know would get a laugh and a shake of your head. It still takes a few seconds to realize it just can't happen.
The issue carries the coverline “Catherine Middleton, the making of a modern princess” and looks back at the magazine’s 95-year history of covering royal weddings.
Here’s the deal. Even if the Lord says directly (or rather, most indirectly via several translations from original texts) that we are to spread the Word – I would say that we have something to consider: Why would the Lord say this? Isn’t the Lord the Alpha and the Omega? He is the beginning and the end and everything in between! Any one of his creatures will know this!
Apart from redistribution, which enables blacks to secure loans to buy or lease land from the government, the land reform programme also includes restitution (state sanctioned theft), by which black communities recover ancestral land.

Looking back, I know I made a great choice for me and my baby as far as our birth plan. I would absolutely recommend Hypnobirthing to ANYONE, and for first time moms, I wouldn’t read ANYTHING before you’ve read the Hypnobirthing book. Much of the literature, online reading and videos available can cause a lot of unneccessary fear. Yes, you will probably have some aprehension regardless, as this is a complete unknown, but it doesn’t have to be the “scary experience” our society often makes it out to be. No matter what kind of birth you want, you and your baby can benefit from this method. Those who casually say “oh we’re going to try to do it naturally but we’ll see how it goes” are usually not mentally prepared for the challenge. For women who would really like to have a natural birth, you have to go into it with a completely dedicated mindset and an understanding of what is going on, as well as a supportive birth team that knows your wishes! I can’t say enough how important it was that we had Dawn the doula for support, and our midwife and the hospital staff on board (with a copy of our written birth plan in hand)! You CAN do this! I will do it all over again the next time around…and I’m actually very excited about round 2!

I am now refusing to cook in my kitchen. I have thrown a lot of our food away. And I will only eat items from the fridge. Each time I nervously enter the kitchen, I mentally prepare myself, make sure I'm not holding anything breakable, and I shout loudly and clap to give them a chance to at least run away and hide so that I don't have to see them strolling around on my kitchen surfaces.
At long last Blonde Redhead took to the stage. Wearing a white wisp of a dress matching her dainty demeanor, the arrestingly attractive Kazu Makino and equally stunning identical twin Italian brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace commanded immediate attention as they delved into the slow-burning “Black Guitar” off their latest effort, Penny Sparkle. Featuring vocal parts by both Amedeo and Kazu, the song took on a theatrical air backdropped by cool blue stage lights and dense fog-machine clouds as the two floated around each other during the vocal tradeoff.

Sleep eluded me as I tried to struggle with a bad cold and cough. In the middle of the night the cool breeze relaxed my restless heart and tired body. I tried to sit up and work on the lappie but somehow did not have the strength. The drumbeat in the cell indicated a text message. There are times when the heart is torn between longing and loss. It’s an emotion which can’t be really described. Tears know not for what reason they flow. My vision blurred I slid out of bed and went to the terrace. Apart from a constant hum of the refrigerator the entire house was bathed in silent glow of the night-light. I still believe that heartstrings are tuned irrespective of physical distances and unseen heard melodies are the ones that make life worth what it is.
The very first post I wrote for this blog almost 5 years ago was called Aiming Low and was about marketers' unrelenting stupidity at targeting young people in advertising.
Roll out dough between two sheets of lightly floured baking paper until 3mm thick. Use a 4cm (1½in) cookie cutter to cut out cookies. Use a paring knife to trim stray bits of cranberry from edges – if the dough gets too soft, place it in the freezer for 5 minutes. Place cookies onto prepared sheets, 5cm (2in) apart, and bake until lightly golden on the edges, about 20 minutes.

Place the chicken in a pan and cover with the buttermilk , 2 tsp. salt and nice dose of hot sauce; allow to set covered in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours , overnight even better. Remove chicken and allow to drain over wire rack set in pan. Combine the flour ,pepper and season salt ; whisk to combine. Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off excess flour. In a large frying pan add the lard and heat until melted on medium heat. Add vegetable oil if needed to fill pan no more then half way. Oil is ready when a handle of a wooden spoon placed in the oil bubbles. Add the chicken , but do not over crowd pan. Fry about 10 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a rack to drain when finished.

“Never mind,” I said walking back to the freezer to put away the orange juice. I learned my lesson long ago about those small and inconspicuous, non-bank affiliated ATM’s which charge anywhere from five dollars or higher for their use. Santorum clone kept smiling like a pleasantly dressed but maniacal serial killer as I walked out leaving me with a slight concern for my safety but an overwhelming urge to wash my hands for some reason.
Over the next three days, I learned how to be a mama of babies in the NICU. I learned about beeps and alarms and three-hour schedules. I saw the names on the isolettes and knew those were my babies. I saw their daddy's nose on their tiny, raw faces and knew those were my babies. I was pumping my breast milk every two hours around the clock to give to my babies. But it was a very intellectual experience. My brain knew those were my babies.

While I was sitting in a suite tonight, waiting for a search warrant to go through, I just kept thinking about the song, “For the Moments I Feel Faint” by Relient K. It was a big song for me in high school. The only line I could remember of the song was a part of the chorus, “You’re telling me that there’s no hope; I’m telling you you’re wrong.” I had a thought, have I been telling myself that there’s no hope? I’ve been known to do so, when I get in a bad enough mood.

But not all initiates make it into the Dauntless faction. Only the bravest. Only the strongest. Only the best. Readers follow Tris (Beatrice) on her new journey. We meet fellow initiates--those born Dauntless, and those transferring from other factions. We follow their training through three stages. They will be challenged physically, mentally, and emotionally. We become familiar with their two trainers--Eric and Four. We see the faction's strengths and weaknesses. As does Tris. On the one hand, Tris realizes she is fierce. She can be strong, determined, brave. She is learning to face her fears, learning to face life. But she's also realizing that compassion and love are part of courage. That selflessness has prepared her for her new life. On the other hand, she sees how heartless, how cruel some are. Yes, the Dauntless have their flaws.
I made sure I read during both my break 15mins and lunch 30mins, with the exception of a few interruptions. The result is that (at 4.30pm GMT) I've now read 23 pages of 'Crusade of Tears' by C.D. Baker in half an hour.

If you’ve liked early books by Berkom, you are sure to enjoy this one even more. This is one of the longer books by Berkom and has good pace balance throughout. As with all her books, this is another great value for the money. And although reading previous Kate Jones books will give context to “Touring for Death” this is really a stand alone chapter in the ongoing saga and readers new to Berkom can easily start with this novel and not miss a beat.

I have also missed worship. Some of the songs really resonate with me and often bring me to tears. This weekend was no exception. In fact, I'm including the lyrics to Before the Throne of God because it is an absolutely beautiful song and describes the love of God in a way that just grabs hold of my heart.

I feel bad that I’ve preached and preached about waiting for the right guy. Maybe I have and Peter will surprise me. Who knows? I just know that I am not holding my breath for this casual tryst to magically turn into a relationship. I still do believe that whether or not a woman is a virgin, she should decide when, where, and with whom she should sleep with. This was the best option for me and I do not regret it. I don’t recommend it to everyone. A part of me wishes that I decided to have sex when I was younger, but I know that I wouldn’t have been able to handle it the way I have now. All I know is that since I’ve lost my virginity, this huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I no longer have this secret. I am no longer the “adult virgin”. I am just Valerie. I can strip off the labels and live the way that I want to. That weekend was for me and no one else.

With this said, I must certainly apologize for the miscommunication generated by the server at your table. She misrepresented the Eat The Whole Menu at The Bent Brick which unfortunately ruined for you what has historically been an epically great experience for all of the guests who have ordered it. Apparently your server led you to believe that we strongly encourage large parties to Eat The Whole Menu. This is not the the point that should have been communicated. We like our customers to order however they wish to order. It's certainly fun for large parties to Eat The Whole menu but how our customers enjoy our menu is entirely up to them.

Living in a world filled with so much bad and ugliness, it is refreshing to be reminded about someone who is truly and totally good and beautiful…in nature as well as in action. In his book, The Good and Beautiful God, the author, James Smith, reminds us of the fact that there is someone in our world who is good and beautiful and that person is God. In his book he does a masterful job at explaining for us just how GOOD and BEAUTIFUL God really is.

For anyone who hasn't read Danny's articles, here's the brief overview. Deadly Premonition is a third-person detective story by Japanese designer Hidetaka "SWERY 65" Suehiro, released in the US back in February. Sold at the budget price of $19.99, it was both panned and lauded by reviewers. It's gained cult status not only due to the polarizing responses it's provoked, but also because of its unrelentingly strange and oddly charming Twin Peaks-esque story and characters.

Last week, when someone dropped me off on the way to the Church office, he was saying that Paul and Timothy had such a good relationship that they looked out for each other and making sure the churches were ok. Especially in times of persecution and oppression. We were talking about a whole different topic but I thought about this later and applied this to our students too and wondered about how we can pull this into helping them to step out into faith. It’s definitely not an easy task to dictate.
Back in the dawn of time (somewhere in the 1990's I think), my Corporate Job Place was built, and some time later, an addition was added to it in order to make navigation more difficult. The ceiling is between 15 and 40 feet high in this particular cubicle farm, with padded grayish-cream colored cubicles set in neat little rows (they are the color of old lady teeth). They are a bit over five feet high, so if I stand on my tippy-toes, I can see the foreheads of other people walking around in the alleys between cubes. I am very good at identifying my coworkers by their foreheads.

Have you ever thought about becoming a real estate paralegal? And not only a real estate paralegal, but a commercial real estate paralegal? Good for you! I found that a real estate deal has a life unto itself and coming to the closing is in some ways similar to approaching the finish line of a corporate challenge marathon. You prepared and practiced for many days; you ran and came to the finishing line. The only difference is that after the award ceremony, there is more work to be done.

If my car doesn’t have everything working properly I get a moving violation and the police are all over it. I find it hard to beleive that a municipal police force would willingly and knowingly allow a cruiser on the streets with a broken video camera.
It is with great pleasure that I give you a look behind the scenes of the most challenge yet most fun photoshoot I’ve had to date. It should come as no surprise since I’m a Porsche enthusiast and Flying Lizard fan that I jumped at the opportunity to work with the team. It all started with some discussions during the off season, then a few months ago the head of PR/marking got in touch with me about a photo shoot concerning images for Le Mans. What I didn’t know at the time were the constraints I would be facing for the shoot.

Description and History – There is little left of this canal side church but it boasts a long history. A church was originally located here in the 8th century when Irish monks were establishing many communities in the area. The present structure is late medieval and may not have had a long period of usage as the Penal Laws brought an end to Catholic worship here as it did to many other churches throughout Ireland. The present church is badly ruined and measures 16m x 7.5m. The E and W walls survive to full height but the N wall has collapsed in recent years destroying very fine Latin inscribed gravestone underneath it. The graveyard contains some very nice gravestones.

So what does this have to do with legalization of drugs? Where is the connection? Here is my position. You can legalize one drug, but you cannot legalize them all. The industry will simply reinvent itself. Not to mention the prison industrial complex is driven by this industry as well. There is simply to much “legal” money tied to illegal activity.

Anyway, Sunday night we were contemplating our drive back to Florida on Monday. It's not such a bad drive-- about 8 hours.

It is, though, a little bit strange that Middle Eastern governments, some of whom have been having a tough time lately, have been quite so generous to Western (and particularly British) universities. A few weeks ago Christopher Davidson (reader in Middle East politics at Durham University) tackled this question in the Times Higher Educational Supplement. He wrote of the "fascination in many of the Gulf monarchies ... with spending vast sums on overseas education projects, even if the domestic sector is left to languish."
What exactly is our national security securing? Certainly not our liberty. We have been sacrificing ever larger chucks of our liberty to the gods of security for decades now and in the interests of securing our liberty have given it all away. Go to an airport if you want to witness the loss of liberty in all its glorious humiliation. One wonders if we actually were taken over by another power and our Constitution dismantled what exactly could they do to restrict our movements, monitor our activities and control our actions that would be any worse or oppressive than what our own government is doing right now?

I have one fella chasing another fella who has left office after work, with no 'message' on what's going on, the chasing fella is jumping high and low as he / she couldn't get things done...
The old man charges after him. “I had a visitor today…. Jamshid Mohammed! What the hell are you playing at?”
Again, this is a mix of new titles and some that I've been after for a while, as well as being a mixture of 'gritty' realism and contemporary humour - sometimes in the same book.
All-in-all then, it is probably best to stick with standard domestic livestock for normal day-to-day travel, preferably a jersey cow, as these tend to have more optional extras when compared to the basic Friesian. For the wannabe boy racers, of course, there are plenty of breeds of domesticated pigs, from the hot miniatures right through to the swill-guzzling road hogs, for them to choose from.
The show is a minefield of symbols -- Michelangelo, Picasso, Magic Eye books, Buddha, a crab, automotive repair advertising, and what may or may not be a fish head. Each of these could compel a witty exhibition, and I genuinely believe that that is what Johnson is trying to do, be as witty as he can while at the same time taking his thought and work in deeper directions. After all, humor often surprises with the quality of its critique. You would expect nothing less from a former student of Charles Ray. Artists like Tom Friedman and Ray do this very well in their work, and Johnson seemingly drew close to their respective practices in his first show.
but my favorite is from Canadian author Margaret Atwood:
If DC really wants to appeal to non-fanboys with the New 52, it would behoove them to have an entry level title that the casual reader can pick up every now and then and get a satisfying single issue reading experience. If this debut issue is any indication, Superman might just be that title. This would be appropriate, since everyone knows who Superman is. He's not only DC's most famous character, but one of the most recognizable fictional characters in all of literature. Therefore, you don't really need to spend a lot of time introducing the characters to new readers. If you were in a comics shop about to pick up your first ever comic book, wouldn't you be more likely to go for a character you already know from movies and TV?
Tettiz is extremely lazy and could spend whole evenings on the sofa watching television. She loves to bake even though she's on a diet. She just has her husband and daughter eat what she makes. She's afraid of snakes. She's obsessive about the kitchen in her house. If the rest of the house is a mess, the kitchen's almost always clean. She was named Jeanette because she was her father's (Jan) first child (one = ett in Swedish). She teaches English and Swedish in H.S. She loves the color yellow and her new yellow beetle says RAW on the license plate. That rocks!
3. What is your favorite cookbook? I love the simplicity of Rachael Ray’s cookbooks – I have every one. Her style is true to my Italian roots, and even when she’s making meals that aren’t Italian in nature, per se, they remind me of the way my mom cooked for us every night when we were little. Hearty and healthy meals. I also love Giada’s recipes. And my sister swears by the recipes she gets from her Sunset cookbooks. Lately, I’ve been pulling a lot of recipes from Eating Right magazine.

I'm not a spokesman for it but you can see it in action with Martha Stewart in the driver's seat. What I really like is how easy it is to clean. No sharp blades just this big heavy grinding 'screwdriver block' that crushes the fruits, veggies, nuts or whatever. The juice goes into the right container while the pulp goes into the left one. Definitely no regrets getting it.
When we test a digital ad, a print ad or a package on-line, we typically use timed exposures of ½ seconds, 1 second, and 4 seconds to measure what elements of an ad are being recorded in working memory.
My first daughter couldn’t join us as she had school. Bummer! Because of the bad traffic, we decided to head back to Jakarta without seeing the wonderful shows you can see at the zoo. That was also a bummer for us. M, J, H and K, Thanks for visiting us in Jakarta!!
This was going to be my April teaser, but the last couple of weeks were busy with the Merola Opera Program’s annual Benefit Gala, A Royal Affair (there are Mélanie and I above in our tiaras). So the April teaser is being posted in early May. It’s a scene from the novella I’m writing about Malcolm/Charles and Mélanie/Suzanne’s engagement and wedding, provisionally titled The Lisbon Bride. In this scene, Charles/Malcolm tells his valet Addison that he’s going to be married. It’s fascinating for me to go back in time and discover who these characters I know so well were at the start of their relationship.
I'm honestly surprised I didn't see any of them wearing this:
Damodar asked, Hi Amit, Is there any particular etiquette to follow for a telephone interview?
If Craigslist refuses to spend any time and money to just make the surfing experience slightly better, what kind of message is that to its users? And most users do not have nearly the skill or know-how that they can make it a more pleasant experience by use of extensions. I can probably guarantee you that most users of Craigslist do not even know what browser they are using.
It made me look at how I had treated her son, at how The Man had viewed her son so differently than I had viewed him. It made me think about her daughter, so much like my own daughter, having to grow up without her mom. And how, as a mother she could so genuinely accept someone who had previously been cruel to her own son.
But it was real interesting because I got to talking about this experience with the silence, and the guy said, “Well, I’ll tell you something interesting. We do a lot of research on Caddo Lake.” Well, you know Caddo Lake. This is basically just a cypress swamp.

This has been a long time coming. I can't blame going back to work as it was already a problem beforehand. I can't even blame my daughter, as it was already a problem before she bounced into my life (erm, not literally).

My favorite of this set is the full body pose. Although it is a static pose, there is a feeling of fluidity and movement here. I just feel she knocked this pose outta the park and I'm pleased with my light and camera angle as well.
I don't know if you're getting where I'm going with this or not. I don't know if I know where I'm going with this.
Brody has gotten this dish many times before and raves about it. It includes crispy rice, sautéed spinach, winter vegetables, bean sprouts, sunny-side up egg, chili paste, and marinated tofu or pork. Mmmm…this was so good! I ate it all but saved room for dessert. My friend Rena and I chose the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake for the table to split, but after everyone else (four other people) took a bite, Rena and I polished it off. Oh, and my drink! While I don’t drink a lot of liquor, I do enjoy anything with gin and grapefruit juice. I ordered the Marquez Collins which obviously had those two liquids but then topped with red wine, all over ice. It was a lovely dinner experience, as it always is at Graze.
Where else you can see Sand Dunes, Ocean, Mountains and the City all at the same location?
We enjoyed the show until all the credits had rolled, but could not find a suitable place for dinner; the tourist season had yet to begin, so almost nothing was open. Instead, after a walk from one end of town to the other, we took the tram back to Sóller for a well-deserved dinner. We would head for Palma the following day, but for that evening we were happy to be living in the moment.
Issues of sex and gender aside, there’s a lot going on in this novel. The descriptions of Tokyo are wonderful. The descriptions of the suburbs and countryside surrounding Tokyo are also wonderful. The secondary characters are sympathetic and vividly portrayed. I loved Komatsu, and Ushikawa, and Professor Ebisuno, and Aomame’s friends Tamaki and Ayumi. The Dowager and Tamaru are a novel unto themselves. The allusions and parallels to political revolutionaries and religious cults in postwar and contemporary Japan are striking. The novel’s challenge to conventional notions of reality are intriguing. The connections between Murakami’s 1Q84 and Orwell’s 1984 (and in particular the transformation of “Big Brother” into “the Little People”) are fascinating.

A couple of nights ago Wesley and I sat down and read this book together. He was able to read a good chunk of it himself and seem to really enjoy it. Its based on the children's song "Five Little Ducks" excepts these cute little bunnies keep hopping away one at a time. The CD that is included in a slip pocket on the inside of the front cover contains the story read out loud by a narrator as well as 19 children's songs like
“I hope through my practices to honor the women, children and men who have lost their lives and who are struggling to survive now,” said Nancy, a resident of Roswell, Ga. “My daily journey will be much easier than theirs. But, I live in a society where people die from obesity and obesity related issues – we die from too much. They die from not enough…”
Those of you who were up there in Northrend with me will remember my last operation was at Light’s Hammer just inside the gates of Icecrown Citadel. You might also remember that I spent most of that time hanging out there with Tirion Fordring. Who I’d already had my fill of, by the way, when I went to meet him with Thrall at his stupid-ass tournament place. (Like seriously, isn’t ONE pansy-ass traveling fair enough for the world?) So hopefully you people were all too busy forging your way into the citadel and fighting our enemies like the Horde soldiers that you are…but meanwhile I was stuck back there with Tirion…who pretty much had nothing to do for a good long time but talk. And talk.

Looking around, in one corner are the “die-hards” who are still kicking on and you may even remember them from Friday night, but you would never go there! Sunglasses, nervous twitches and sideways glances – there is a slim chance that they have showered, and can let alone speak by this stage.
Start a school that teaches the ‘children of a lesser god’ for free, even better, pays the parents for sending the children to school.
What I’d really like to bake is some nice chocolate cupcakes with icing or a peach pie with some vanilla ice cream on the side. But alas, those things are now a distant memory. I’m not saying I’ll never eat those kinds of things again, but I can’t be having a whole batch of chocolate cupcakes or a whole peach pie in the house…I’d want to eat it all at once! And as hubby doesn’t really eat cakes or pies except on very rare occasions, it would just be me eating this stuff. Not a good thing.
It’s a fantastic chase sequence – imaginative and fun and aided by a rare GOLDENEYE appearance of the Bond theme, it’s the moment where Pierce Brosnan really becomes James Bond as it shows off Bond’s ability to improvise on the run and never lose his cool.
It wasn't one of the more visually or intellectually challenging pieces they've done on the show. But it was a visual feast. That final slow-motion bit was especially great.

J and I went for lunch here on my first day. After several minutes agonising over what to choose form the menu I decided on Green Tamales & Eggs for $11.75 described as ‘spinach corn tamales on a pool of tomatillo salsa topped with two eggs any style, avocado-tomato-cilantro salsa, toasted tortilla strips, sour cream and cilantro.’

Hendrix first looked deeper into marital psychology after his marriage ended in 1975. He thought the prevailing therapy of the time, loosely termed ‘conflict resolution’, focused too much on compromise. “What we found, and what the whole discipline of marital therapy in America found, was that it simply didn’t work, because a part of us is always resentful if we have to give things up,” he says. “Also, it was very cognitive – ‘there’s the problem, here’s the solution’. Like fixing a car. But people are not like machines.”

A plus point for me was that fantasy and magic play almost no role in the plot, much less than in the previous two books (This might explain in part why I thought In Winter’s Shadow the strongest of the trilogy). Gwalchmai still has his Otherworld sword and horse, but if they have any magical powers they are scarcely mentioned. Medraut is said to serve the ‘Darkness’, as his evil sorceress mother Morgawse did before him, but for the most part this could be taken as a metaphor for ordinary human vices such as cruelty and greed.

3 years later, she was invited by the company who produce Mr.Children. She wanted to manage them again but instead the company ask her to manage new group. She didn’t want to do other group so she left the company and look for the boys. Because the vocalist was dead, she did a talent search and found a rock band singer, Eugene. She tried to get Eugene to sing as a solo without his band, but he disagreed. Finally, she could get him by paying his nephew’s hospital fee for 24 months. She trained the boys very hard and with minimum cost. However, prior to debut Ji Oh (one of the boys) who has a bad temper suddenly attack the rival group from the other company (the company that previously employ Oh Gu Ju). Thus, she pulled back their debut time and instead debuting on a music program on TV they start singing for patients and disabled people. The response was great and Mr. Children starts to get popular.

Today, our Program Director, Sarah Rial, and I will make the 7000-mile trek to our partner Kurnyuk School for Girls in the world’s newest nation. It’s a grueling itinerary—6 hours from Boston to Amsterdam; 8 hours to Nairobi; 11 hour-layover before the 1.5 hour trip to Juba. We overnight in South Sudan’s boomtown capital, before taking the 1.5 hour flight to less cosmopolitan Wau; .5 hour jumper to even less “cosmo” Maluakon followed by the .5 hour drive over dusty, bumpy, potholed “road” to the Kurnyuk School located in quintessentially v-e-r-y rural Akon. Did I say the trip was grueling? Oh yes, and the temperatures average 106 degrees; the nighttime bugs can be fierce and latrines are often simple holes in the ground. That’s why our want ad reads, “Divas need not apply….”

I had to stand the husband in front of the microwave and ask him what he uses it for. He said, "Um, well, to heat things up. I just used it...the other week. Oh, well. To boil water?" He brought it in to work so other people can kill themselves slowly by using it. I Freecycled the toaster.

Anyway, we were all ready for bed around midnight, and hit the pillow and were asleep. CPT was awake and gone before I got up (to PT), and my alarm went off at 6:45am. The kids were SO excited to go in and see Grammie and Grandpa Harty. At 7am, right before Tom left for for school, I let them go in and see them. Joe needed his backpack and Jim needed his shoes (they were staying in their room). They were SO excited!!!

Cllr Peter John said: “Local councils are facing unprecedented cuts from the Tory/Lib Dem Government. We know that we’re going to have to change the way we work to rise to the challenge those cuts present and carry on making the improvements to local services that our residents need.

For my take, cans certainly have their advantages, and craft beer drinkers love their convenience and portability. Hopefully, the market will soon demand that Ball and its competitors come up with a way to manufacture effective BPA-free cans.

This was a trip that almost didn't happen. Flight prices were all over the place and just when I found a REALLY good deal (like $140 round trip) the prices shot up the next day and then a few days after that, the airline filed for bankruptcy and cancelled every flight until May! Every other airline was so expensive out of every city and I just became discouraged. That is, until I found a flight out of Grand Rapids, MI through AirTran. For about $220 round trip and with decent flight times. We've never flown out of Grand Rapids before but the airport will be really simple to get to and will be shorter drive than we're used to going to Detroit.
Anyhoo some fairly good news which i will be announcing either late this thursday or early friday may mean i increase my work load but also enjoyment in Sheffield and mean i see some of you bloggers, writters, or plain old beer enthusiasts a little more often.

Or I see a picture from high school. I remember walking down those paths lined with roses or crossing that lawn, going into that orchestra room, sitting on the steps of that gym. And you were there. You were always there. You are as much a part of that scene as the buildings in the background, I can’t think of that place without thinking of you, and how we were always together, as often as we possibly could be, because that was how much we loved each other.

I now realise there’s a bit of gap at the front of the shed, just underneath the diamond-shaped decoration that’s attached to the front of the pitched roof. You can’t see the gap, but I can put a few of my fingers through it. I had a quick look around for signs of nesting, I couldn’t see anything. I doubt that particular bird will return but it’s possible other birds will enter our shed during quiet months seeking refuge or looking for suitable nesting sites.

Anxiety and stress, often as the result of a traumatic life event, are sometimes the cause of nightmares and bad dreams. Not all nightmare triggers have to be traumatic, however. Everyday stressors, such as job or financial anxiety, or major life transitions such as moving or divorce, can also cause nightmares.

Despite the Academy Awards being a celebration of all things Hollywood, New York has actually hosted the Oscar ceremony on more than one occasion. Or rather, they co-hosted the event -- from 1953 to 1957 -- in a rare and soon abandoned bicoastal ceremony that taxed the mechanics of television's earliest production crews.
If one considers that the broadcasting rights of the IPL (Indian Premier League) were sold for US$ 1.026 billion and the brand is reportedly valued at US$ 4.13 billion, this may have been an error in judgement by ProBatter, unless of course the bowling application was never foreseen.

Calling on someone by name immediately grabs that person’s attention. It makes them aware of the individual’s intent to engage in a conversation or to offer up a cordial greeting. Our names give us identity, a sense of self-worth, and sometimes our names offer up clues as to our ethnicity, the place we come from, the type of person we are or want to be. Occasionally our names even come with titles that allude to our education or type of job we are enjoying. Names are essential to mankind’s community and communicating with each other within that community. And so it is with our Creator.

For the basecoat I used a very dark grey color, it´s called Antracita here. Really dark, no “blueish” tone whatsoever. After that I went with drybrush. You know this plastic minis have a very smooth surface. Metal minis usually have some texture, no matter how hard they try to make the part smooth. I don´t know if I´m making myself clear here. The point is that I did a very very detailed drybrush. By that I mean I used a small brush and went from a dark grey to a very light one. I did like 5 or 6 steps of grey (from dark to light)

Seriously, if anyone ever has seen her TV show, "Roseanne" a bulk of episodes deal with how the government does not understand or care about the middleclass. Even if she could only run for a lower government position, I believe she could do some good. he only thing I'd worry about is her getting support from the House of Senate and what not, since she does not want to run as Republican or Democrat. It's highly doubtful she could make it in the proper running, but it's definitely a nice thought.
I have two daughters, so I knew I was going to write a heroine. But I wanted the books to have a mythic quality, after all we’re talking about Templars and monsters and archangels. So I based Billi on the mythic heroines like Athene, like Boudica and the Rani of Jhansi, all powerful warriors as well as being female.
That’s why I am so bothered by the party’s recent loss of two up-and-coming Republicans: San Diego mayoral candidate Nathan Fletcher, currently a state assemblyman, and former assemblyman and current Congressional candidate Anthony Adams, both of whom left the party to become independents.

As you know, the frequency of the planet and of humanity’s energy signature is rising in preparation for the approaching New Age. The higher the frequency of an entity’s energy signature the more spiritually evolved that entity can become. A low frequency tends to be dense, almost leaden, and it is very difficult for Knowledge or Love to flow through it. Consequently, it is very difficult for beings whose frequency is low to communicate, and they get lost within themselves, rather like the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand.

As Atlantic Yards Report suggests, she likely picked up her parlance directly from the developer. The Observer reports that Ms. Burden met with the developer/subsidy-collector Bruce Ratner only a few months before her remark. (See: Ratner Meets With Burden, by Matthew Schuerman, September 6, 2006) comments. According to that report Burden “wouldn’t give her own thoughts” but said of Ratner and Atlantic Yards “he did not mention scaling it back.”- (If you check your dates, the scaling-back reference is because this is exactly when the drama of the project’s faux size-reduction was taking center stage.)

Most American Colonists were English, so most Colonial homes are derived from English styles. The earliest were based on old medieval homes, easily identified by simple massing, a few small windows, and massive chimneys. The New England saltbox with its lower back roofline is a common adaptation of the medieval style; Dutch Colonials have similar massing but are distinguished by their distinctive gambrel roof style.

If the left doesn’t like what you have to say, they will ignore, demean, accuse without proof, libel, shout down discussion, ignore the talking points and create their own, accuse without proof using lawfare, create their own reality while ignoring facts to uphold their elitism, sue, and never, ever, debate face to face on neutral ground because that’s now how the left operates. Where the right would let the populace within a democracy decide their own fate, the left believes their point of view usurps the majority for their own good. Read the rest at Clay and WaterSun News is a bastion of free speech in Canada, and it is under attack for speaking the truth about islamic supremacist and leftist tyranny. There is an organized campaign to have the Canadian government shut them down, in yet another Orwellian push to stifle the voices of political dissent and silence those who stand for liberty.

A business owner’s policy (BOP) might be the perfect fit for your small business insurance needs. Make sure you understand exactly what is and what is not covered and if needed, secure additional coverage to fill in any gaps. By leveraging the cost savings provided by BOP coverage, businesses can ensure they have the protection they need at a price they can afford.

The truth is, if you aren't living as an ethical vegan, you are paying other human animals to imprison your fellow animals, to murder their babies and to murder them...to keep them from the 'available to all' pleasures of the Earth. Or maybe you're committing those horrors yourself, directly...I don't know.

Ben's dog is very pleased that I just gave her a new bone to chew on lol. Her name is Hershey and she misses her family VERY much. She didn't eat for the first couple of days. Now she's sleeping upstairs in Ben's room with me, eating her food, playing outside, and happy to have a bone. She doesn't like it when *I* leave to go home for a little bit though. She's taken things from Ben's room a couple of times, gotten into the trash, etc.

I joined the Palo Alto Run Club (PARC) last May, a group full of talented, hard working running and got a bunch of great runs in. Those "easy" five milers where we'd start hitting 6:25, 6:10 pace I think paid off. Do enough 6:25 miles in your regular runs, and it'll start seeming like nothing. And there's something about the shared experience of a run with others that makes all the hard work more meaningful.

A while ago a friend of mine sent me a YouTube video entitled ‘Try something new for 30 days’. I instantly fell in love with the idea and as 2012 approached I decided to make up for all the resolutions and Lent’s I’ve failed to complete by setting myself a challenge each month. I’ve already completed my first month and have been canvassing for suggestions for the rest of the year. One suggestion was to keep a blog diary every day for a month. So to get me into the swing of things I thought I’d let you in on my journey so far.

But now the shadows are all gone. Don’t think for a minute that cancer won that battle. Yesterday, Ralph’s cancer was buried in the ground for good—it’s done, it’s over, it can’t do him anymore harm. And what about Ralph? Well, you remember what Jesus said to Martha as they stood next to Lazarus’ grave? “I am the resurrection and the life. He that believes in me, though he were dead yet shall he live. He that lives and believes in me will never die.” Ralph lived and believed in the Lord, and that means that Ralph is alive and well with the Lord today. It may not look like it on the surface, and it doesn’t much feel like it right now in our hearts, but Ralph won that battle with cancer, and he’s taking his victory lap in heaven even now. You know, heaven—that place where cancer can never find its way in.

The Finish - The finish was about as cruel as the finish of Marine Corps. While there was no mountain to climb at Mile 26, there were somewhere between 5 and 8 inflatable arches...all of which I thought were the finish and kept sprinting toward. When I finally saw the Finish Line (still with about 3 arches to run under), I saw a bunch of little kids lining up in front of the barricades. There was a man in front of me who ran over to one of them, a little boy about 5 years old, grabbed his hand and ran across the Finish Line hand in hand with his son. I started tearing up and when I finally crossed, I was so emotional. I had done it. I had run Madrid. I finished my 4th marathon. I ran an unbelievable first 20 miles, well on pace for a sub-4 race. I never lost that sub-4. I never fell apart but when the realization came that my body couldn't run a sub-4 marathon after 3 weeks of eating and sleeping poorly, I didn't give up. I pushed through and I finished strong.
The job.

Whew. I went to bed at 7 last night and I'm feeling much better. I basically relied on fake enthusiasm to get through the day, and it worked. No major meltdowns (which have been almost daily for one of mine lately) and my lowest kid finally made it past 50 words a minute! (Yes, the goal for the end of the year is 90, but he was stuck in the high 20's/ early 30's for so long that this is a HUGE victory!)

Madness showcased songs from their brand new, as yet untitled, tenth studio album, in all its glory during their 'rehearsal set' this past Friday night at the House of Fun Weekender in the U.K. As with ‘The Liberty of Norton Folgate’ which the band performed live a full year before its release, Madness gave the new album tracks an early airing in their embryonic state for their most hardcore fans who attended the show. Quite a few of the songs have been played live during the band's summer tour, but it was the live debut for more than half the songs on the set list.

For so many years, I was so incredible in manifesting anything that I wanted in my world. I would write it in my journal, I would visualize it and I would believe it. Within 3 months, 6 months, or any time frame I set, it would show up. I know manifestation works because I’ve done it, tried it and succeeded at it. And now I’m taking a really deep, long breath, breathing into my heart and soul and being and just knowing that the right people, the right opportunities and clients are going to all come. I need to get out of my own way of any negative feelings and self-doubt. I mean, listen, I’m human. I know I need some of that or else I’d be on the stratosphere to the moon.
Harkaway’s writing is mindbogglingly imaginative: memorable characters, logic-defying (yet never quite illogical) plotting, and unpredictable twists. Angelmaker is much like a finely-built baroque clock: gazillions of pieces in constant movement, adding up to something gorgeous.
What I loved most about this flick was how the fighting, action, and blood were filled with so much energy and were better than half of the shit I’ve seen in the past 10 years, that I wanted more of it. Right from the beginning we get a nice little fight between The Bride and her second target on her list and it seems goofy because of all of the swooshing you hear when they move, but it’s so vicious and so brutal that it’s hard to laugh especially when these chicks are very close to just gutting the other person out. It’s a very minor scene but it’s one that starts the film off on the right foot and the action just keeps getting better by getting more vicious, more violent, and a hell of a lot more bloody. The blood is insane in this flick and it may be a bit ridiculous how Tarantino just makes every single kill have blood shoot out from these people, but it still gives this film this cool and deadly look that could only be achieved with an R-rating. Actually, it’s more of a very hard R-rating, one that only Tarantino can get because he’s the freakin’ man.
It is described as the realisation of the nature that each human being already is, as if an inverted and limited experience of life and of reality suddenly gives way to the all encompassing experience of the world as it truly is, the deeper and universally encompassing reality described by mystics, poets and saints throughout the ages from all races and all religions. And for the first time, suddenly, the words of religions and of the mystics, are comprehendible.

Well, maybe you’ll think that I’m totally crazy, but please think about it. Ever since I started to read 1/2 Prince and I saw that he sings (as you’ll find out later that he has a band), I always campared him to G-Dragon. Yeah, I know that Prince sings really different songs, but I still compared them. I always imagined how Prince is singing ‘She’s Gone’. XDDD Oh, but everything got really complicated when I saw this pic of G-Dragon… O_O

He’s a really cool guy, and I really like how he was able to give me a big-picture view of where the firm is currently, and where he’d like it to be using marketing. Also, I found out that I’ll be traveling to Washington, D.C., for a week with the firm after finals! Exciting stuff.

Starting with a wonderful loaf of going-stale bakery bread, I put together a recipe that I know will make its way into my breakfast repertoire on special occasions. When, I have a breakfast/brunch menu consisting of the usual sweet options (scones, muffins, fruit etc.), I plan on using this recipe to balance and offer guests a surprising and delightful twist on a classic.
Thus, what I have put together in the cake is what I feel in my opinion; arguably one of the best mango cake that you have ever taste. Although the recipes are not mine per say, however I always go to my trusted and tested recipes whenever I try to put a cake together. If you love mango plus it's another perfect summer treat, do read on for the recipe. I am sure your friends and family will be asking for seconds to third helpings. Enjoy!

Compared to these states, America has a special problem. These other countries are largely the result of “organic” historical processes that pushed their different populations together. America, by contrast, is much more the product of far-ranging economic processes, like Trans-Atlantic emigration from Europe and the African slave trade overlaid with modern mass immigration. Because of this different racial elements have been thrown together, and are much more disparate in character. This creates much greater ‘asymmetry’ in the differing racial characteristics, especially between Blacks and Whites.

That said, this is a big example of Not Getting It. Yes, of course women and people of color do many of the same things that white guys do, but that doesn’t mean that white guys should be considered a generic avatar through which everyone can experience the world. Is a black woman likely to have similar frustrations as a white guy when stuck in traffic? Probably. But said white guy probably isn’t also worrying whether he’s going to be assumed to be lazy and irresponsible when he’s 20 minutes late to work just because he has dark skin and boobs. We all exist in the same real-world universe, and many experiences are at least somewhat universal. But the particular filters through which those experiences come to us can be very different, especially when it comes to marginalization and privilege. Would I still watch Game of Thrones if it didn’t have a wealth of gender-noncompliant women? Probably. But I’d enjoy it a heck of a lot less because I’d be experiencing that world in a far more secondhand way than I can when I see what’s happening to Arya or Brienne as they navigate their way through a world that sees unpretty women as automatically suspect. It’s a far more personal and engaging way of experiencing a story when there’s a character with whom one has significant commonalities.

That way if he's forced to use them, the inevitable butt-kicking is a big surprise. I was bothered by a so-called karate expert once. I had finally had enough and confronted him.

The thought was sobering. As the camp grew, problems grew. It became more difficult to maintain order. There were many women alone or with children. There were a number of teenage girls quickly turning into women. Hood had noted the looks of many of the single men. It was natural but it was dangerous. Among other things, they were all sitting on a hormonal powder keg, its fuse lit by a collapse of society and its rules and norms. There were still remnants of the social mores of civilization, but many of them, like the economies of now-bankrupt nations, were teetering on the brink. One small nudge in the wrong direction … one minor crack in the code of discipline and the Freeman Militia Center could quickly turn into something ugly.

Yes, love can be wonderful and strengthening and buoying, but only if it works both ways. In my situation, it simply wasn't. He has no clue how to love. Call it a mental deficiency, a chemical imbalance, it doesn't matter. I gave my love to the wrong person. Plain and simple.

The nurse came in and said my midwife was eating down the street and wanted to know my dilation. So I got out to be checked. She said I was a 4 1/2 cm and %80 effaced. I was immediately discouraged, and now knew why women choose not to be checked. I stayed out of the tub for a while and birthed on the birth ball, tried to walk around (standing in any way seriously made contractions hurt so much worse) even laid on the bed for a little bit. I was now moaning and even crying with each contraction. My nurse was monitoring them and confirmed they were 1 min apart sometime 30 seconds apart, lasting 60-90 seconds.

This was done on the fly, made as one of 12 original pages for a documentation book of a cd swap. (It was #3.) The photograph is one of my signature old photographs; it always makes me smile. and I love how well it works in the spontaneous structure of the page.
Look at rap music - first, it was a music from the gutter, from the ghettos, angry music, detailing the daily struggle to survive, the depression, the hatred of the system that kept a young black man down, and then...
"Yeah, but don't you know Jorge is getting a million bucks for doing this?" a voice interjected in the hopes of deflating my euphoria with a green dart of jealousy.

There are two reasons why these rationalizations annoy me so much. One, people always assume the best case scenario if one circumstance goes their way.
I am very fortunate to have a very loving partner. We have been together for 12 years now. She is 16 years older than me and she does just about everything – the food shopping, picking up my meds, and anything else I need done.

Besides, she also claimed that a national campaign to survey and identify poverty-ravaged populations in the country was almost complete. That presupposes that the campaign had long started. According to her, the survey will inform and direct strategies for addressing poverty within each segment of Nigeria’s population, including the elderly, women, children and persons with disabilities. A UN news release also quoted Dr. Gbeneol to have said that the one year cash transfer policy for poor families in Nigeria is one of the success stories of President Jonathan’s administration, with 113 local governments in the country as beneficiaries.

It really all began two years before we moved to Portland, about four years ago. I moved to Lake Louise, and shortly after, Ty followed. It was one of the most beuatiful places I have ever lived. But friends? They were practically non existent. How could they be? The culture there is party town. Everyone got drunk. Moste everyone did drugs and slept around. We were the token christians. I tried. believe me, I tried. But people just viewed me as naive and cute.
Schools of social work, and associations of social workers, have a vested interest in making social work sound grand and glorious. Let me put it this way: if you want to get your janitors excited about their job, and if you want to inveigle others into hiring on for the same, you don’t dwell upon the part that involves cleaning the toilet. Instead, you characterize it as facilitation of world-class organizational systems within an industry-leading milieu. If you want people to become social work students and then to graduate and become dues-paying members of your social work association, that is, you impress upon them the solemn significance of such affiliations.

In addition to the Starbucks vandalism, a group of about 150 were seen tipping garbage cans and spray-painting anarchist symbols on storefronts, sources said.
Joseph was faced with choosing a door towards his own escape or trusting God to offer a door and path beyond his own initial understanding. What questions and answers did he face from the public? What possible answers did he seek from God, and more importantly, Mary? I imagine Joseph’s initial thoughts and approach to solving this for himself would be no different than our own approach today. Perhaps, Joseph sought quiet solitude as well as experienced feelings of confusion and anger? What would be your self dialogue? Who would you talk to about such a dilemma? Eventually Joseph had his questions answered. Text from the book of Matthew brings into account Josephs dream encounter with an Angel of God explaining simply, “Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for she has conceived a son which is from the Holy Spirit.” Could this have been the point where he really questioned his own faith?

That girl in the red dress? She played happy really well. A smile went a long way to convince people — to convince herself — that she was happy just as she was. She was uncomfortable in her own skin, and she was missing out on a lot. But, still, she never took the steps she knew she needed to lose the weight that was holding her back.

My sweet Connor James, you are one month old! This past month has been so bittersweet (mostly sweet though!). The day you were born and that sweet moment when I first saw you and you wrapped your little finger around mine when they layed you on my chest is something I will never forget! You have brought so much joy into our lives already but the sleepless nights have worn on your mommy this month.
You do know how to invest in the right place at the right time.
She cloth diapers! Her daughter is in cloth, so of course my son is in cloth with her too!
It's 4:30 in the morning, and this is what happens. I mean, I had a moderately arid day... did some Christmas arcade and sat around, mostly. But I did administer to achieve something 9-year-old me is air-conditioned appreciative of, I'm sure.

The small scapulars with which we are familiar as sacramentals owe their origin to a reduction of the large scapulars that formed part of the habit of Religious Orders and Congregations. This scapular was another of the scapulars approved during the reign of Pope Leo XIII without a confraternity. Although it was never the habit of any Order or Confraternity the Congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart, founded at Antwerp in 1873 created this scapular in 1877 and were responsible for its promotion (Acta S. Sedis, XXXII, 633 sq.). It was approved at the request of the Archbishop of Marseilles, by the S. Congregation of Rites in 1900. Indulgences were granted to those who wear it habitually in 1901 and were enlarged in 1906.

And the bill came up to something close to 2k. Umm...no, I want the $875 doors please. Apparently the door prices were mis-marked, but he did go through door company after door company, and threw in promo after promo to get us down to the $875 price. We had a 10% off coupon too, and he told us to go up to the service desk to pay for it, and we could use it there. Apparently they're not allowed to double dip, but if you go up to the service desk to pay, they don't know that there's been promotions applied already to the door, so you can generally get away with using another 10% off coupon.

Some people know, others don't, but both me and my son were in mental hospitals within about the last 30 days. I had only been out for 2 days before he went in. Is it because of life issues or medication issues, or both? It feels like only I am asking that question. I don't feel good and I am not sure why. I have lots of guesses.

Emboldened by my success, I started eying the steep slope in our Batangas property. I shook my head, No it’s too crazy, that slope is too steep. But I couldn’t resist the challenge. I thought to myself, I can easily stop the bike once it reaches the garage. I’ll just put my foot down. I went up the slope and rode my bike. It was so fun until I needed to stop. I put my foot down, but the friction between my tsinelas and the ground destroyed my tsinelas. I used my other foot to stop the bike, but my other tsinelas was destroyed. I was barefoot. Without my tsinelas, I knew that if I put my foot down, the ground would cut through my skin. The bike was going faster and faster as I went down the slope. I was afraid that I would go straight to the talahib an area where snakes waited.
Well, I know the digi is called Canary Love not Bluebird Love and I had the intention of coloring the bird yellow but somehow grabbed the wrong Copic and well, now I have a Bluebird. But at least he matches her eye color. I also added some glossy accents to the heart, rose, buttons and the red around her legs.
1. J.Crew "and I quote"NEW AND UPDATED WEBSITE. My arse! Ok for about 2 weeks, I couldn't even pull up J.Crew, then it was all "NULL/$" and "No sizes" - ARGGGHHH. Then, my hub said try viewing it through Internet Explorer (instead of Firefox, which I use) - which helped, I got to see the sizes of the clothing for sale but it was sooooo slow.
And there you will see your reflection.
Can you try to push to amend legislation about how many terms that a president is able to serve because I miss you! Now granted, a great deal of people still have you as a tainted president due to your marital transgressions against your wife and I am NOT condoning what you like other politicians have done. HOWEVER – This country’s statistics do not lie and you obtained financial freedom and pushed a great deal of legislation to get passed for the betterment of ALL people especially minorities – so thank you. ( The African American Community still have you pinned as the 1st Black President and you know why ) Anyway, I am positive that you have also thought about wishing that the bi -laws were different via presidency as well because watching your wife Hillary Clinton in her present position is as close as you will get to running The White House Affairs.
I have no idea why this would be worth documenting except that there are always piles of laundry in my house. Perhaps it has become an integral part of what makes a place "home". The possibility of missing the piles of unwashed clothes must be prepared for with pictures to ease the pain of separation. I should reassure her that the piles of laundry will always be there for her.

Work on the arch had started at Buckingham Palace in the mid 1820s and it was completed by 1833. It was originally moved to replace Cumberland Gate as the new entrance to Hyde Park and to complement Decimus Burton’s arch at Hyde Park Corner. Successive roadworks in the 20th century, however, left it in its current position.

In the fourteen years I spent at three universities in the 60s/70s I acquired a store of memories that resembles Kevin MacDonald’s, if at a greater distance from the radical Jewish milieu. I too perceived the radical politics, feelings of separateness and alienation, attitude of moral and intellectual superiority, hostility to Western cultural institutions, ethnic paranoia and bunker mentality, disdain for capitalism, generic tendency to impute and then combat perceived racism and fascism, disputatiousness and intellectual sophistry, negative attitudes toward Christianity, positive attitudes toward psychoanalysis and Marxism. I too had charismatic Jewish professors with a leftist view of European and American history.
The USS booklet then goes on to continue to avoid mentioning CPI, and uses ‘official pensions’ as a euphemism, or synonym, for CPI. It sounds more unavoidable, more authoritative, perhaps. So, when the term ‘official pensions’ is used in that paragraph, reproduced here below, you can replace it with ‘CPI’:
Some people play paintball to get a paintball game. Paintball has become rapidly more aggressive since it's invention. Formerly, a game involving the paintball gun cases that will enforce safety circumstances. Particularly seeing that a player can not see past the paintball gun cases a bruise. Also, since wind resistance starts slowing the paintball gun cases an intensity and passion into practicing and training for your sport. Develop a regular schedule of practice for paintball. It is essential that all paintballers stay safe with protective paintball gear like pads, chest protectors and gloves. Each paintball game starts with a large area of paintballs. But that ton of paintballs becomes a deterrent to training as often as you want them to be, ranging from just one bunker to one more in order to accelerate the paintball gun cases at your field based on your air tank refills to anyone with an empty tank even if they're not field customers.
The preschool that Ella was in last year and this year has a tradition the week before Thanksgiving that involves the director of the school making pumpkin waffles for all the kids. I can not tell you how much Ella loves these. She talks about them for weeks. In fact, another parent who had helped with the waffle making, stopped me in the hall when I was picking Ella up and told me that Ella had seconds and wanted thirds. I thought, are you sure you got the right kid? Because getting my Ella to eat is sometimes like pulling teeth. This girl just doesn't like to sit and eat.

After the deposition of Mubarak, foreign aid, which the country greatly relied upon, was suspended in Egypt. Now, many countries are focusing on reestablishing foreign assistance in the hopes of being able to play a part in Egypt’s new political state and influence future developments in the country (Ruivaran). The United States has heavily financed Egypt’s government, including Mubarak’s oppressive regime, of which the United States overlooked the abuse of human rights. This financial aid to Egypt holds some roots in the 1950s, when many Western European countries and the United States were looking to support those “autocratic local leaders who would keep order and were most sympathetic to their Cold War policies – a opposed to those of the Soviet Union – and were most likely to maintain a friendly attitude toward U.S. and European business interests” (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 265). The new government and its new policies will complicate the U.S. involvement and interests in the region. In the future, the U.S. will have to take into account their previous act of turning a blind eye to the misrepresentation of human rights and promote a full democratic government in the country. The Muslim Brotherhood, currently in control of much of the government, is traditionally an anti-Israeli group, which brings the possibility of tensions between Israel, a U.S. ally, and Egypt, two countries which currently share a Peace Treaty since 1979. A new government led by the Brotherhood could overturn this treaty and “indefinitely affect U.S. military, trade, and diplomatic policies” (Travers). Egypt also happens to have a geographically important location in regards to the Suez Canal “which allows transport of over 2 million barrels of oil per day out of the Persian Gulf” (Travers) and therefore gives Egypt some control over oil prices and the cost of international shipping. The region itself is known for its oil exports, prices of which are mostly controlled by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which also include countries in Latin America and the Far East (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 278). However, in the event that transportation costs for shipping oil rise, the cost of oil will also increase, impacting consumers all over the globe, especially Americans who, as a nation, consumer more oil than any other country worldwide. Though Egypt is not a major producer of oil, the country’s control of the waterway gives it the power of affecting the global economy through oil prices.
A new post on Brooklynology reminded me of a fine piece of history written by my colleague Dennis Holt. Dennis had the good fortune to stumble upon an 1885 edition of Lain's City Directory. It was sitting atop a pile of someone's garbage heap, and I can guarantee you he clicked his heels on the way home after finding it. It's true what they say about one man's trash...

There is a worthy message in The Ambassadors of Death but you have to drudge through quite a lot of padding to find it. Judging by David Whitaker's track record I can't help but think the stronger parts of this story are down to Malcolm Hulke's extensive rewrites. There are some good performances by John Abineri as General Carrington, William Dysart as Reegan and Cyril Shaps as Lennox but sadly the story is overburdened by too many unnecessary and over long action/stunt sequences. This is one of the rare times where I would have preferred the structure of the New series of Doctor Who. This would make a great story if it were condensed and speeded up a little. There are parts of The Ambassadors Of Death that are great but overall the story is hit and miss. I think it is fair to say that a large part of that was due to it's rocky conception.
Today, I am told, is Budget Day, when the preposterous George Osborne is going to tell us how our administration is going to screw us this year.

It is no surprise that most of you are modernists, not totally throwing away your traditional roots. Many of you don't choose to purchase patterns, which we suspected. You are very creative and improvisational. Then again, many of you are collectors of patterns and books; sometimes one or the other. I can say that since I started designing, I certainly purchase fewer patterns and some books. Part of it is confidence, the other is time (not enough to possibly make it). There is sometimes reward in creating "what you see is what you get". In remaking samples, I just follow the pattern and don't have to endure any brain freezes! Patterns are more affordable, especially in these economic times.

I like to think that a standard that can ring true across cultural divides is the religious standard for both male and female. The Bible speaks of the man as one with God-given authority, and the woman as a more fragile, submissive role. It gives the man authority but it doesn’t give him a license to treat the woman as property or an object to be used. Instead, he is to be a courageous leader, one who cherishes his family. The woman is to be virtuous, industrious, caring and a helper.
I woke up this morning and decided to catch-up with local and national affairs via television and the world wide web. I read many stories this morning but nothing as funny as the business with Richard Grenell. Above are three of like five or six articles I read from the Google news feed involving Richard Grenell under the tab of ‘Politics’. Anyway to sum up (feel free to check it out yourself) Richard Grenell is an adept foreign policy expert hired by the Romney campaign as their foreign policy spokesman. He’s also gay…openly gay……I know…how did “Romney” and “openly gay” get mentioned in the the same breath. Here’s how : while the Romney campaign may have *quotefingers* broke ground*endqoutefingers* in hiring a openly gay spokesman but his constituents repaved it in driving the man to resign…not that he had done very much on the official (aka TV, reports, press, etc) side anyway. Many laugh at the situation as the Romney campaign’s half-hearted ploy to win support from the LGBT community. I’m laughing at Richard Grenell…..for being a duck (think of your favorite Aflac commercial).

Marisa (her age finally matches her number of moves) is glad to start settling down again. Her schedule is mostly empty and she is enjoying that time. She is trying to find homes for all the boxes and is getting rid of a lot. “If I have not used it by now – WE DO NOT NEED IT!” She is realizing though, that without a lot going on, she does not get a lot done. But then again, tea parties, primary songs, making cookies, and saving the empire on Lego Star Wars is getting something done, right.
